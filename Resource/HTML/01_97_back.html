<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Western lowland gorilla</b> </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Gorilla gorilla</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 308 pounds (140 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The mighty gorilla is the largest of the ape family. It has coarse, black hair on most of its body, except for its broad chest, face, palms, and the soles of its feet. Mature male gorillas are called silverbacks because they have a streak of silvery gray hair running down their back. Gorillas live in groups of up to 20 females and young, which are led by one dominant male silverback. They eat mainly fruit, and spend the day searching for fruit, resting, and grooming each other.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 50,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Swamp rain forests in Central Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females begin to breed when they are 8&#8211;10 years old. They are pregnant for 9 months and give birth to 1 young. They breed every 3&#8211;4 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Between 1992 and 2007, one-third of all western gorillas died when the Ebola virus spread through the population. This disease has since declined, but now threats to the gorillas come from loss of their rain forest habitat and from being hunted. Their forests continue to be cleared for timber, fuel, new farmland, and settlements. In addition, civil wars in the region have led to large numbers of human refugees moving into the forests. Hunters have killed many gorillas because of the growing demand for bushmeat. Unfortunately, gorilla meat is popular because it is seen as a status symbol. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>International trade in gorilla meat is illegal and there are a number of protected areas where the gorillas live. However, not much is being done to ensure that the protection laws are enforced. Far more money is needed to protect the remaining gorillas, both inside and outside protected areas, for example, for anti-poaching patrols. Educating local communities is vital to show the people how to manage forest resources, and to provide them with reasons to protect the gorillas, such as sustainable tourism that will bring money into their areas. In addition, more protected areas are needed. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Adult males perform noisy displays to show off in front of other males or to scare away any intruders. They stand up and beat their chest, run around ripping up and throwing vegetation, and running at other gorillas in a mock charge. </p>
