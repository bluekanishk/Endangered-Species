<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Cheetah</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Acinonyx jubatus</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4.5 feet (1.4 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> Up to 3 feet (9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 159 pounds (72 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Cheetahs have a brown coat with black spots. The "king" cheetahs (a rare color form) have a coat with bigger black blotches and stripes along their spine. Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals and can reach bursts of speed of up to 60 miles per hour (95 kilometers per hour). These sprints last for 20&#8211;60 seconds only, and often leave the cheetahs so out of breath that they cannot keep their kill from being taken by scavengers. Adult cheetahs live alone. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 12,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Savannas of sub-Saharan Africa; a small population of 200 lives in Iran</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 or 3 years old. They are pregnant for 3 months and give birth to 2&#8211;4 cubs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>10&#8211;12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The cheetah is a top predator, like the lion and leopard, and small areas of grassland cannot support large numbers of predators. This means that a healthy population of cheetahs needs an extensive area over which to hunt. Unfortunately, as more of their habitat is being lost to farming and new settlements, cheetahs are experiencing more competition from other predators. They are often chased off their kills, and lions and hyenas kill their cubs. Cheetahs are also coming into conflict with farmers. Thousands of cheetahs have been snared or trapped by farmers in order to protect their livestock from attack.   </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Some cheetahs live in protected areas, such as the Masai Mara in Kenya, where there is plenty of space and prey to support the top predators. More than a quarter of the cheetahs live in Namibia, where the Cheetah Conservation Fund and Afrikat are working with farmers, showing them ways of protecting their livestock so they can live alongside the cheetahs, for example by using guard dogs. Afrikat has rescued more than 1,000 cheetahs that have been trapped, snared or injured on roads, and returned them to the wild. Education programs are very important, too. </p>
