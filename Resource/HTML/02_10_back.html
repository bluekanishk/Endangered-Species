<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Humboldt penguin</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Spheniscus humboldti</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 2 feet (65 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 9 pounds (4 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These medium-sized penguins have a black back and flippers, a white chest with black markings, and a pink band around their bill. They feed on fish, krill, and squid. </p>
<p>They are named after a cold current of water that runs from the Antarctic to the equator that was named after a German naturalist called Friedrich Humboldt. These penguins can dive to depths of nearly 500 feet (150 meters), but usually dive to about 164 feet (50 metres). </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Between 3,300 and 12,000 breeding pairs</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rocky coasts and islands along the coasts of Peru and Chile in South America</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They lay 2 eggs that are incubated by both parents and hatch after 40&#8211;42 days. </p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 15&#8211;20 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These penguins were hunted for their meat, oil-rich blubber, and skin, while their eggs were collected. A new threat is overfishing, especially of anchovy their favorite food, which means the penguins have to swim for longer to find food. Also many birds get entangled in fishing nets. These penguins have used the same nesting sites for hundreds of years and over this time a thick layer of droppings has built up that the penguins use to dig hollows for their eggs. The droppings are known as guano and this is now harvested and sold as a fertilizer. When too much guano is removed, the penguins cannot dig burrows in which to nest, and so they have to nest on the surface, which means their eggs are not so safe and more likely to be taken by predatory birds.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Humboldt penguins are now protected, and hunting is banned in Argentina and Chile.  Most of the Humboldts' important nesting sites are protected and the harvesting of guano is strictly controlled. However, one site in Chile is threatened by the proposed construction of two coal-fired power stations. The Peruvian government has established the Guano Islands and Capes National Reserve, the country's third marine reserve. But overfishing in the region continues to be a threat, and it is important that the Pacific fish stocks are controlled so that there will be enough food for the penguins in the future.  </p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Male and female Humboldt penguins look almost identical and it is difficult to tell individuals apart just from their appearance, so each bird has a unique voice that others can recognize.</p>
