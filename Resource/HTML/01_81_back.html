<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Reindeer</b> also known as caribou</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Rangifer tarandus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 feet (1.8 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 4 feet (1.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 600 pounds (272 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The reindeer is a medium-sized member of the deer family with hoofed feet that are broad and flat for walking in snow and on swampy, mossy land. Reindeer have thick fur and short tails, and can smell out lichen and other food under deep snow. They live in large herds usually made up of females and young, or males only. Each year during spring and summer the male reindeer grow large antlers, which they use in fighting contests to see who will mate with the females. After the mating season, the antlers fall off. Females also have antlers, which they use for their own protection and that of their young.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Arctic tundra, forests, and mountains of northern China, Alaska, Scandinavia, United States, and Russia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 2 or 4 years old. They give birth to a single calf. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Reindeer have long been hunted for their skin and meat, and this is still a threat. Hundreds of years ago, reindeer were captured and domesticated. Today, these domesticated, herded reindeer are kept for their meat, skin, and antlers. Conservationists are concerned that the domesticated animals may breed with wild reindeer. In Alaska, oil exploration along the coastal plain of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is a potential threat to the nearby area where the females give birth. Climate change is also a threat to all reindeer. If the snow thaws too early, it makes it difficult for the reindeer to reach their grazing grounds, and high snowfall in extreme winters is causing starvation.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In the Canadian Arctic, the hunting of reindeer is banned for all except the Inuit and Inuvialuit people who are allowed to hunt a certain number of animals. Conservationists in Canada are working together to produce a plan to prevent the extinction of the wild reindeer and help their numbers increase. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Reindeer make the longest migrations of any other animal. During the winter, they migrate to the Arctic and some herds might travel for more than 3,106 miles (5,000 kilometers).</p>
