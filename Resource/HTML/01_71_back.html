<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Polar bear</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ursus maritimus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTRISTICS</h2>
<p>Polar bears are the largest land carnivores. They have a big stocky body covered in thick white fur, and powerful legs with webbed paws. They have small ears for their body size, so they lose less body heat, and fur on the bottom of their feet to help them walk on ice. They are strong swimmers. Pregnant bears hibernate in the winter in a den, a cave that they dig in the snow. During hibernation the females give birth to one or two cubs. The female bears dig their way out in the spring. Their main diet is seals. Polar bears live solitary lives but groups are often seen around a good food source, such as the body of a dead whale.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 21,000&#8211;25,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Sea ice in the Arctic</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 5 or 6 years old. They are pregnant for 8&#8211;9 months and give birth to 1 or 2 cubs. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 15&#8211;18 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s, polar bears were hunted almost to extinction. They survived, but are now under threat from global warming. The bears depend on the sea ice for hunting and breeding. The break up of this ice is starting earlier in the year and the amount of sea ice melting in the summer is increasing. This is making it more and more difficult for the bears to reach their hunting grounds. The bears are having to swim further to reach the places where they find food and many drown at sea. More polar bears are suffering from starvation, and are unable to survive the winter, fewer cubs are surviving, and adult polar bears are getting smaller. As bears are forced onto land to find food, so they come into conflict with people and are shot.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1973, Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Norway, the United States, and the former USSR signed the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears. This prohibited the hunting of the bears (with a few exceptions for local people using traditional methods), and required the nations to protect areas where the bears made dens to give birth, and their routes to the sea. However, the threats from global warming, such as rising sea levels and the early melting of the ice cap, can only be reduced through international cooperation to reduce the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.</p>
