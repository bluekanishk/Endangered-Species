<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Rothschild's giraffe</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Giraffa camelopardalis ssp. rothschildi</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height:</b> Up to 20 feet (6 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1.5 tons (1.5 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The Rothschild's giraffe is one of nine sub species of giraffe, and each sub species has a slightly different coat color and pattern of spots. This giraffe has a light, cream-colored coat covered in large, dark brown blotches, and white legs. Its long neck and long legs make the giraffe the tallest animal in the world. It feeds mainly on the leaves at the top of acacia trees, stripping the leaves off the branches with its tongue. The giraffe's tongue and lips are extremely thick to protect them against the thorns on the acacia trees. Giraffes live in large herds made up of both males and females and young.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Less than 650</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Grasslands of Uganda and Kenya</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 3 or 5 years old. They are pregnant for 16 months and give birth to a single calf. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This giraffe suffered from loss of habitat after the Second World War, when huge parts of land in western Kenya were sold as cattle ranches. Now the remaining giraffes are restricted to a few areas. In northern Kenya they have suffered from poaching for their meat and skin.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE?</h2>
<p>Rothschild's giraffe has already disappeared from the Sudan, and with so few individuals remaining in Kenya and Uganda, it is now on the brink of extinction. The largest population of about 70 animals survives in Soysambu Conservancy in the Kenyan Rift Valley. Very little is known about the ecology of this giraffe, which makes conservation difficult. Biologists working for the Rothschild's Giraffe Project are gathering essential information to devise a conservation program. </p>
