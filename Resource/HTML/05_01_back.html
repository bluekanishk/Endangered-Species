				<h2 class="fish">NAME</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Bluefin tuna</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Scientific name:</b>
					<i>Thunnus thynnus</i> (Northern or Atlantic bluefin tuna), <i>Thunnus orientalis</i> (Pacific bluefin tuna), <i>Thunnus maccoyii</i> (Southern bluefin tuna)</p>
				<h2 class="fish">SIZE</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Length</b>: up to 10 feet  (3 meters)</p>
				<p>
					<b>Weight:</b> up to 990 pounds (450 kilograms) </p>
				<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
				<p>The bluefin tuna is one the world's largest bony fish. Its torpedo-shaped body is a silvery white color. Tuna swim in great shoals of thousands of individuals. Tuna have two types of muscles so they can swim slowly or put on fast spurts of speed. They cruise slowly through the water with their mouths open to catch food, such as crabs, or dart quickly to catch prey, such as anchovy. They can also swim over long distances.  </p>
				<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
				<p>Unknown</p>
				<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
				<p>Critically Endangered (Southern), Endangered (Northern), Least Concern (Pacific)</p>
				<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
				<p>The Northern bluefin is found in temperate water throughout the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The Pacific bluefin is found in the North Pacific Ocean. The Southern bluefin is found in the temperate and cold waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. </p>
				<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
				<p>Females breed when they reach 4&#8211;8 years of age. They lay up to 10 million eggs in one spawning period.</p>
				<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
				<p>Up to 30 years</p>
				<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
				<p>Bluefin tuna was once common, but overfishing since the 1950s has endangered the Northern and Southern bluefin tuna. The Northern bluefin may soon disappear from the Mediterranean Sea as well as from parts of the Atlantic Ocean. The plight of the Southern bluefin is very serious and unless numbers start increasing soon there may be fewer than 500 individuals left in 100 years. Today, many commercial fishermen use hi-tech sonar and airplanes to find tuna to catch. In many oceans there are strict quotas, but the World Wildlife Fund estimate that some fishermen are taking up to 50 percent more than they should, and there is also an increase in illegal fishing. Another threat is tuna ranching, where tuna are caught alive and moved to cages to be fattened and sold. Also, the tuna suffer from water pollution from sewage and oil. In addition, tuna feed on smaller fish, which have also been overfished so the tuna have less food to eat. </p>
				<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
				<p>The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas is responsible for the conservation of tuna in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In 2006, the Commission published a 15-year recovery plan that involved strict quotas and periods when the tuna could not be fished. Controlling the fishing of the Southern bluefin is more difficult as the fish migrate long distances. It is listed in Annex I of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which manages global fishing quotas. Quotas have been reduced in recent years and there is better monitoring of catches. However, more controls are needed on tuna ranching, especially in the Mediterranean and around Australia, and it is hoped that the ranches will breed their own replacement stocks rather than take them from the wild. The bluefin tuna grows very slowly so it will be many years before it is known whether or not the conservation measures have worked. </p>
