<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Asian elephant</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Elephas maximus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 21 feet (6.4 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6 tons (4.5 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants, they have much smaller ears and a humped back. They have a thick, grayish, wrinkled skin, and big, solid legs. Their tail can grow to up to 4 feet (1.3 meters) long, and has a tuft of coarse hair on the end. The Asian elephant's trunk ends in a single lip, unlike that of the African elephant that ends in two lips. Usually only the males have tusks. The females live in small herds, led by an older female called a matriarch, while the males usually live alone. Elephants use their trunks to grab mouthfuls of grass and leaves, and use their tusks to scrape bark off trees to eat. When they run from danger they hold their tails up, possibly as a signal to the rest of the herd.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 40&#8211;50,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Grasslands and forests of India, Southwest China, and Southeast Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 10 years old. They are pregnant for 22 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 3&#8211;4 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 60&#8211;70 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>For a long time the main threat to the Asian elephant was hunting, but now it is habitat loss. Their forest home has been cleared for timber, fuel, and farmland. The male elephants have ivory tusks that are very valuable, so poaching is a problem in some areas. As the human population is Asia increases, so more people are living much closer to the elephants. This causes the animals a lot of stress as they do not like disturbance, and so there is more elephant-human conflict. Hungry elephants destroy crops and the farmers shoot them to protect their livelihood. Elephants are responsible for the deaths of as many as 300 people a year, when they raid villages or come across people in the forest. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Asian elephant is listed in CITES so international trade in its ivory is banned. India has an extensive network of national parks and reserves where the elephants are protected. However, these areas are often too small for all the elephants, and so some move out onto surrounding farmland. Conservation organizations are establishing a network of wildlife corridors to link the protected areas. Also, they are working with farmers to establish fences that will keep elephants off farmland, and to compensate the farmers for crop losses to try and stop the farmers killing them.</p>
