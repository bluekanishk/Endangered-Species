<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Golden hamster</b> <br/>also called Syrian hamster</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Mesocricetus auratus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 7 inches (18 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 7 ounces (150 grams)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This small rodent has reddish-brown fur with black stripes around its shoulders and white undersides. It has a small body, short legs, big eyes, and no tail. Golden hamsters are nocturnal and forage for their food at night. They eat root vegetables, seeds, grasses, and other vegetation. They use their cheek pouches to carry food back to the burrows they dig in the sand. Their burrow usually consists of long tunnels with separate rooms for storing food, sleeping, and "toilets." They live alone.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry, sandy plains in the Middle East, southeast Europe, and Southwest Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for about 15 days and give birth to between 4&#8211;12 young. They breed 2&#8211;3 times a year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 2 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Much of the golden hamster's desert habitat has been lost to new settlements, and what little remains is under threat. Hamsters are considered to be pests by farmers because they feed on crops. Unfortunately, their burrows are easy to spot and farmers put down poison or traps to catch them.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Little is being done to conserve the golden hamster in the wild. However, there are millions of golden hamsters in captivity, as they are popular pets. In the late 1990s, a small number of golden hamsters was caught in the wild and taken to Germany as part of a captive breeding program. </p>
