<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Philippine eagle</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Pithecophaga jefferyi</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 63 feet (91 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 14 pounds (6.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These are the world's biggest eagles and also the most endangered. Philippine eagles have white and black body feathers and shaggy brown feathers around their head and neck that look like an untidy mane. They have yellow legs with big claws, and a strong bill. They eat small monkeys, lemurs, rats, snakes, birds, and bats. They sometimes hunt in pairs with one eagle attracting the attention of the prey while the other attacks from behind.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 250 </p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical rain forests throughout the Philippines</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females start to breed at about 5 years old. They lay 1 egg and incubation lasts for about 2 months. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Between 30&#8211;60 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main cause of the decline of Philippine eagles has been habitat loss. The tropical rain forest in which they hunt and nest is being logged at an increasing rate, and the surviving forest fragments are often too small to support many eagles. The eagles have been hunted too, an activity that is now illegal. A number of injured birds have been found to have airgun pellets in their body. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The eagle is listed on CITES Appendix I, and is protected by law in the Philippines. Current research includes the monitoring of nest sites and the tracking of adult birds to learn more about their behavior. Wildlife corridors are being established to link the remaining fragments of forest. There is also a captive breeding project in the Philippines run by the Philippine Eagle Foundation. This program has bred 14 eagles, which may be released back into the wild. The Foundation also rescues injured eagles and returns them to the wild when they are well enough.</p>
