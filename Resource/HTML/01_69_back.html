<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Orangutan</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> (Borneo), <i>Pongo abelii</i> (Sumatra)  </p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Orangutans walk upright and on all fours. They have long arms and legs that they use to swing through the forests. They have a reddish-brown shaggy coat. They are arboreal, spending most of their time in the trees and rarely touching the ground. At night orangutans make a nest of leaves and twigs in the trees where they sleep. Adults live alone or as pairs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Borneo less than 54,000, Sumatra approx. 7,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>The Bornean orangutan is endangered; the Sumatran orangutan is critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical rain forests and wetlands of Sumatra and Borneo, Southeast Asia </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 15 years old. They are pregnant for 13 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 53&#8211;58 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Orangutans have been hunted for hundreds of years, but today the main threat to both species of orangutan is habitat loss. Rain forests are being cleared at an ever increasing rate to make way for oil palm plantations, farmland, gold mines, and other uses. In fact, 80 percent of the orangutans' habitat has been cleared in the last 20 years. Many of these animals have died in fires, which swept through the forests in the late 1990s, fires started by people to clear the land. In addition, some females are deliberately killed so their babies can be sold as pets.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Orangutans need a large area of forest in which to thrive, so the best way to conserve these apes is to protect their habitat. There are National Parks in Borneo and in Sumatra where the orangutans are protected. However, illegal logging still takes place around the borders of many parks, so their survival is still under threat. There are several rehabilitation centers that take orangutans from captivity and release them back into the wild, such as the Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah (North Borneo). </p>
