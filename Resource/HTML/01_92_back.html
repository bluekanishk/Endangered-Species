<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Striped skunks have long black fur with a white band on the their back and a black stripe&#8212;each stripe is unique to each individual skunk. They have a long bushy tail and long claws on their front feet for digging to make burrows where they sleep. They feed at night eating small mammals, insects, fruit, nuts, and fish if they are near water. Skunks are best known for their smell! When they are threatened, skunks arch their back, stamp their feet, and raise their tail in warning. If this fails to put off any predator, they turn their back to the enemy and squirt a foul-smelling liquid from their anal glands that can reach up to 9 feet (3 meters). The spray causes sickness and burning eyes, and the smell lasts for days.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 4 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Skunks were hunted for their valuable fur during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then it became less popular. Skunks are still hunted in Canada, but the levels are not a threat to its survival. Today, the main threats are from habitat loss, disease (especially rabies), and from people. Many are killed because they pose a threat to poultry, or they become a nuisance in residential areas where they enter gardens. Others die on the roads. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The striped skunk is a protected species, but it is legal to kill skunks that are a nuisance in gardens or that are attacking poultry. Skunks are often found on farmland and grassland. Some farming practices can be easily changed to benefit skunks and other wildlife, for example leaving crop stubble rather than ploughing the crop into the ground after it has been harvested. The stubble provides cover and food for the skunks, unlike bare earth. </p>
