		<h2 class="fish">NAME</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Humphead wrasse</b>
			<br/>also called Napoleon fish and Maori wrasse</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scientific name:</b>
			<i>Cheilinus undulatus</i>
		</p>
		<h2 class="fish">SIZE</h2>

			<b>Length</b>: up to 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) </p>
		<p>
			<b>Weight:</b> up to 421 pounds (191 kilograms)</p>
		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>The humphead wrasse is one of the largest fish to be found on coral reefs. They have a big, flatish, disc-shaped body, thick lips, and a hump on their forehead. They have a yellow-blue, stripy body pattern. These wrasse live alone searching the reef for food during the day, and sleeping in a favorite resting place at night. They feed on reef animals such as crabs, slugs, and clams.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Unknown</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Endangered</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>Tropical oceans from the Red Sea and the coast of East Africa, to the central Pacific Ocean</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Females begin to spawn when they are about 5 or 6 years of age. Spawning can last for up to 60&#8211;75 minutes at a time, with groups of up to 150 spawning together.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>Approx. 30 years</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>The humphead wrasse is highly sought after in the restaurants of Southeast Asia, where it can fetch a lot of money, and so it has been overfished for many years. The wrasses's slow rate of reproduction means that numbers have fallen rapidly. This fish does not take bait on hooks so it is caught by spearing or stunning using cyanide or dynamite, which kills many other coral animals, too. It is also threatened by the loss of coral reefs around the world as a result of climate change and pollution. In addition, young wrasse are collected in the wild and sold to the aquarium trade.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>The humphead wrasse is protected in many countries, for example the Maldives banned the export of this fish in 1995. Then, in 2003, Australia banned the collection of the species other than for limited educational purposes, while in Guangzhou Province, China, a special permit is required to sell it. In addition, international trade in this fish is controlled by CITES, which allows trade but only with valid permits. However, the most effective way to conserve the humphead wrasse is to educate people so that they do not choose to eat it in restaurants. </p>
