<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>California condor</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Gymnogyps caligornianus</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p>Length: up to 4.5 feet (1.3 meters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan:</b> up to 9 feet (2.7 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 25 pounds (12 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>California condors are one of a group of hunting birds called raptors, however they are scavengers, living off dead meat (carrion), which another animal has killed, rather than killing their own prey. They have black body feathers and a short mane of feathers around their neck. These birds also have a bald head, which is usually white to reddish-purple in color. The bald head is a hygiene feature of scavenger birds, which need to stick their head inside the bodies of dead animals to feed. It means that their heads remain clean of any blood or flesh, which would otherwise stick to their feathers. California condors can soar to heights of 15,000 feet (4,572 meters), and often travel up to 150 miles (241 kilometers) a day in search of food, which they spot with their excellent eyesight.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 104</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry forest and scrubland in southwest America</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay 1 egg and spend a lot of time caring for the chick. They have the longest nestling period of any bird&#8212;about 5 months.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Average 60 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Condors have suffered from loss of habitat, egg collection, hunting, and environmental pollution. During the 1960s, their numbers declined due to the use of DDT as a pesticide. DDT made the shells of their eggs very thin and so the chicks did not survive. More recently, condors have suffered from lead poisoning by eating the carcasses of animals killed with lead shot. Others have died after being poisoned deliberately. By 1985, only nine birds remained in the wild and these individuals were captured and moved into a captive breeding program. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The California Condor Recovery Program has saved this species from extinction. The captive breeding program was successful, and in 1992 a number of birds were released back into the wild. The first wild chicks hatched in 2002. The aim is to establish at least two separate breeding groups. The birds have been released in Arizona, California, and in the Sierra San Pedro de Martir National Park of Baja California, Mexico. The birds are monitored after their release so that scientists can judge if they have enough food and space, and whether there are any threats to their safety. The birds are taught to avoid electrical power lines before they are released.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The color of the skin around the condor's neck changes to match its mood! This is a form of condor communication. The usual color of its skin is pale pink, orange, red, and yellow. It becomes a much deeper pink/orange when the birds become excited and during the breeding season.</p>
