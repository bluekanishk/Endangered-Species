<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Shoebill</b> <br/>also called the whalehead or whale-headed stork</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Balaeniceps rex</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4 feet (1.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 15.4 pounds (7 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>A wading bird, the shoebill is named after the shape of its bill which looks like a shoe. Its powerful bill is very impressive. It can be up to 9 inches (23 centimeters) long and 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide. The bill has an extremely sharp hook at the end that is perfect for catching food from the water, such as lungfish, water snakes, rats, and even young crocodiles. The shoebill has a sturdy body and head with blue-gray feathers, and long legs. They live alone and hunt mainly at night. When hunting they stand in the shallows watching for prey, and when something moves the shoebill shoots forward to catch it in its massive beak. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Swamps and marshes in tropical East Africa, from Sudan to Zambia </p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3&#8211;4 years old. They lay 1&#8211;3 eggs that hatch after about 30 days. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 30 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The wetland habitat of the shoebill is disappearing quickly. Many wetlands have been drained and turned into farmland, while other wetlands are suffering from drought and water pollution. Shoebill nests are frequently disturbed by people who collect their eggs, or they are trampled by cattle. Many shoebills are shot for meat, and others are captured and sold as pets.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The shoebill is protected in many countries and it is listed on CITES Appendix II. There are shoebills living in a number of protected wetlands, such as Tanzania's Malagarasi Reserve and the Sudd Swamp in Sudan, both of which are Ramsar sites. Education is important to teach local people to look after the shoebills and to encourage ecotourism in the wetland areas. </p>
