<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bush dog</b>  </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Speothos venaticus</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2.5 feet (75 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 10 feet (30 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 18 pounds (8 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Bush dogs are small animals with a long, round body, short legs, a short, bushy tail, and a pointed muzzle. Their thick fur is a reddish color. They also have webbed feet. Bush dogs are very rare and secretive, and not much is known about how they live in the wild. They live in groups and sleep in dens, which might be a hole in the ground or a hollow tree trunk. They eat lizards, snakes, birds, and small rodents. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Wet forests and wet grasslands in north and central South America </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They are pregnant for 2&#8211;3 months and give birth to 3&#8211;6 pups. They breed every 3&#8211;4 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to bush dogs is the loss of their habitat, both forest and grassland. This is as a result of the expansion of farming, and the building of new settlements. Bush dogs are coming into closer contact with people, which means more are shot and poisoned, and they are coming into contact with domestic dogs which carry disease. </p>
 
<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Bush dogs are protected in most of the countries where they live, and hunting is banned. However, little is known about the bush dog so more research is needed before an effective conservation program can be drawn up. There are a number of wildlife centers breeding bush dogs, such as Palm Beach Zoo, but as yet no bush dogs have been reintroduced back into the wild. </p>
