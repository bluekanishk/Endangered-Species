<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Sun bear</b> <br/>also called Malayan sun bear or honey bear</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Helarctos malayanus</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 2.3 feet (70 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 176 pounds (80 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Sun bears are the smallest of the eight bear species that still exist. They have short, dark brown to black fur, with a lighter patch of fur on the chest. They have a small head and small, round ears. Sun bears have the longest tongue of any of the bears, which they use to lick up larvae and honey from bee nests. They also eat fruit, small insects, and birds. Sun bears have very big feet compared to their body size. They have hairless paws and long, sharp, curved claws that are ideal for climbing trees. They have very loose skin around their neck, so that if they are bitten on the back of the neck by a predator they can turn around easily and bite back.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests in Southeast Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4 years old. They are pregnant for about 95 days and give birth to 1&#8211;3 cubs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 28 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The sun bear has suffered from habitat loss and hunting. The widespread deforestation of tropical rain forests in Malaysia and Indonesia, together with the illegal logging of protected areas of forest, is forcing the sun bear into smaller and smaller fragments of forest. In other areas, poaching is the main threat, especially in countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam. In some areas, bear numbers have fallen by 50 percent. The bears are killed for their gall bladder and paws, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. The bears are also killed because people fear them, and want to stop the bears from destroying their crops.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The sun bear has long been listed on CITES Appendix I, but despite this and national protection, the poaching continues. Conservation organizations have identified areas of key bear habitats, which need to be protected from both logging and poaching. There are a number of captive breeding programs around the world, such as that of Singapore Zoo, but the bears are difficult to breed in captivity. </p>
