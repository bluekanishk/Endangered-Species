<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bengal tiger</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera tigris tigris</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 500 pounds (225 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These magnificent wildcats have an orange coat with black, stripy markings that are unique to each animal, and a white underside. They have a broad, flat head, small ears, and powerful jaws that can crush bones, as well as extremely sharp teeth. The Bengal tiger is an excellent hunter and will pick its prey, stalk it, and then pounce. It can eat prey much larger than itself, such as water buffalo, small elephants, and rhinoceroses, but its main diet consists of deer and wild pigs. Tigers live alone and hunt at night.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests, woodlands, and mangrove swamps of South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh)</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females begin to breed at 3&#8211;5 years old. They are pregnant for about 4 months and give birth to 3&#8211;4 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 5 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Tigers have been hunted for hundreds of years and this was the main reason for their decline until the 1930s. Then habitat loss became a major concern, as the human population in South Asia increased and forests were cleared for timber and farmland. Tiger habitats have decreased by almost half in the last 10 years. Some tigers were killed because they came into conflict with people. But the major threat today is poaching. Tigers are killed not for their fur, but for their bones, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. It is estimated that in India at least one animal is killed each day. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Bengal tiger is a protected species across its range, and it is listed under CITES Appendix 1. In 1973, Project Tiger was set up to establish tiger reserves across India, and, by 2008, there were more than 40, including Corbett and Ranthambore National Parks. Funding has come from the local government and organizations such as the WWF. Conservation organizations are working to stop the trade in tiger body parts which will stop poaching, reduce the conflict between people and tigers, protect habitats, and educate people about the importance of saving the remaining tigers. There are also a number of captive-breeding programs, with 1,500 tigers living in zoos and wildlife parks.</p>
