<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Apollo butterfly</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Parnassius apollo</i></p>

<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 3.3 inches (8.4 centimeters) </p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The Apollo butterfly has white wings with black spots on the forewings and red eyespots on the hindwings. The red eyespots can fade in the sun, and often look more orange on older butterflies. The eyespots on a butterfly's wings are there to confuse would-be predators, such as birds. The Apollo caterpillars are black with orange-red spots down their sides. The butterflies feed on nectar-producing flowers.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Meadows and pastures with rocky areas close-by (for the caterpillars) throughout Europe and Central Asia</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay eggs on the food plants in the summer, which hatch the following spring. The caterpillars need to feed on stonecrop and houseleek plants to survive.</p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 1 year</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>People have collected the Apollo butterfly for many, many years because of the beauty of its wings. The butterflies are killed, mounted on card, and then sold. Also, the alpine meadows where the butterfly is found have been cleared to make way for new plantations of trees, roads and tracks, ski lifts, and holiday resorts. The caterpillars are found in meadow grasses and these are trampled on by people and also by livestock, such as sheep and cattle, that graze in those meadows.</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Apollo butterfly is protected in many countries across its range, and is listed on CITES Appendix II so trade is controlled and permits to hunt it are required. There are some captive breeding programs that breed butterflies for collectors, and these have helped to reduce the hunting of wild butterflies. However, the best way to conserve this butterfly is to protect its habitat. Some conservation organizations are working with farmers to ensure the meadows are undisturbed during the months when the caterpillars are present.</p>

<p class="wow inv"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The wings of butterflies are covered in rows of tiny scales that give the wing its color. The transparent edges to the wings of the Apollo are caused by scales dropping off.</p>
