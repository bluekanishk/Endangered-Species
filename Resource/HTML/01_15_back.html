<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Barbary macaque</b> <br/>also called Barbary ape, but it is not an ape</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Macaca sylvanus</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 27.5 inches (70 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 22 pounds (10 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These largish monkeys have a silky, gray-brown coat and a hairless face. Barbary macaques can live in groups of up to 60 individuals, but the average is about 24. The strongest male dominates the group. The females mate with all the males in the group so that the males look after all the young, because there is no way of knowing which is their offspring. Females stay with the group for life but young males leave and find another group when they reach sexual maturity. Macaques eat mainly fruit, leaves, bark, and roots, but occasionally they also eat small invertebrates.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 12,000&#8211;21,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Gibraltar and the forests of North Morocco, North Algeria</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2&#8211;4 years old. They are pregnant for about 5 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 1&#8211;2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Barbary macaques were once found across the whole of North Africa but now only exist in a few isolated areas. They were hunted for a long time, but recent threats have included loss of their forest habitat due to logging and forest fires. Some fires are natural, but people wanting to clear the forests start others. Barbary macaques raid crops and damage trees by stripping the bark, so farmers and foresters consider them to be pests and trap them. There is also a risk of rabies from local dogs. Some young macaques are trapped and sold as pets. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are a number of national parks and reserves where the macaques are protected, but most of the Moroccan macaques live outside the protected areas. Little is known about the species so research is taking place with the aim of establishing a conservation program. </p>
