<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Red-headed vulture</b> <br/>also called Indian black vulture or Pondicherry vulture </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Sarcogyps calvus</i></p>



<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 34 inches (86 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 8.5 feet (2.6 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 14 pounds (6.3 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These vultures have a bare, red head and red legs, and black feathers with white patches all over their body. They have two loose, red flaps of skin called lappets, one on either side of their neck. They live alone or in breeding pairs. Courtship includes acrobatic displays of soaring and somersaulting. Like other vultures, they eat carrion.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Less than 10,000</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Woods, forests, and open countryside of Southeast Asia</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay 1 egg that is incubated by both parents. The egg hatches after about 45 days.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Over the last 12 years the numbers of red-headed vultures have fallen by a massive 95 percent. This is due to the use of a drug called diclofenac that causes kidney failure in vultures. Farmers use the drug to treat their cattle and it remains in the cattle's bodies when they die. In India the bodies of dead animals are not collected but are left to be picked over by scavengers, such as vultures. So when the vultures feed from the dead animals, the drug poisons them. Other species of vulture have been affected, too.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The governments of India, Nepal, and Pakistan have banned the use of diclofenac, and a drug that is not harmful to the vultures has replaced it. However, some farmers are still using up existing stocks of the drug. In Cambodia, the Cambodia Vulture Project is putting out "safe" carcasses at seven vulture "restaurant" sites. They are hoping to encourage ecotourism at the feed areas to pay for the food. In countries where diciofenac is still available, there are education programs aimed at farmers to persuade them not to use it. Captive breeding is important too, in case the wild populations do not recover. </p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>As many as six different species of vulture can gather on a large animal carcass. There may be some squabbling, but mostly each species has its own preferred bit of the animal on which it feeds.  </p>
