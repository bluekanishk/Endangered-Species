<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gray wolves are the largest animals in the dog family. They have thick, gray fur, long, slim legs, and a thick tail. There are several different species of these wolves and some have gray, brown, red, black, or almost white fur, depending on where they live. Wolves are sociable animals and mostly live in packs. Each pack has a very strong hierarchy, and is lead by a top male and female that form the breeding pair. The wolves hunt large prey, such as moose, deer, and wild boar, but they will also eat smaller animals, fruit, and berries. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>16,000 plus </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Snowy grasslands, temperate forests, mountains, and deserts across Canada, Alaska, northern United States, Europe, Middle East, and Russia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3&#8211;4 years old. They are pregnant for 9 weeks and give birth to 1&#8211;11 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 8&#8211;13 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Gray wolves have a bad reputation and have long been hunted. They have been shot, trapped, or poisoned simply because people fear them or want to protect their livestock. Others were hunted for their fur. By the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, wolves had almost disappeared from the U.S., with the exception of Alaska, and were severely reduced in Canada and Europe. Today, they are still hunted across much of their range, and they are also suffering from habitat loss and the fragmentation of their remaining forest homes. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1973, the wolf was listed as endangered in the United States and so was given protection. During the 1990s, wolves from Canada were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park, and into Idaho. Since then their numbers have slowly increased. Education has been important, as the increasing numbers of wolves has meant that they have come into conflict with people, especially farmers. However, farmers have been shown different ways of protecting their livestock from wolves. Other conservation programs involve the fencing of areas where wolves have been reintroduced and compensating farmers for the loss of their animals to wolves. The gray wolf is protected in much of Europe and parts of Asia, but not in the Middle East and Russia.</p>
