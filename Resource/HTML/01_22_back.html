<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bonobo</b> <br/>also called pygmy chimpanzee</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Pan paniscus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 3 feet (0.9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 99 pounds (45 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Bonobos look very similar to chimpanzees, but they have a black face and black hair with a parting down the middle, while chimpanzees have a pink face and no parting in their hair. Unlike chimpanzees, which are often quite aggressive, bonobos are very sociable and live in large groups, caring for each other and their young. The females rule the groups, which are run by one dominant female. Bonobos eat mainly fruit but will also eat small mammals and insects. They spend a lot of time in the forest canopy moving gracefully through the trees, searching for fruit and other food, but they will sometimes travel on the ground. At night they make nests in the trees, where they sleep.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Largely unknown, probably less than 50,000 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 13&#8211;14 years old. They are pregnant for 7&#8211;8 months, and give birth to a single young. They breed every 4&#8211;6 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 30&#8211;40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The two main threats to bonobos are habitat loss and hunting. Huge areas of the Central African rain forest have been logged, and this has broken the bonobo population into small groups. People in the region have long hunted the bonobo and other wild animals for meat, which is known as bushmeat. Recent continuous civil wars and the poverty of the local people have resulted in increased hunting, which is destroying wildlife across the region. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>A number of surveys have been carried out in recent years to estimate the numbers of bonobos that survive in the forest. This knowledge will help in the conservation of the species. Conservation organizations, such as the Bonobo Conservation Initiative, are working with local communities to encourage and educate people so that they protect the remaining bonobos and their habitat. Several new bonobo reserves are being planned, but there is a continuing threat from illegal logging. The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has passed laws to protect the bonobo, but law enforcement is poor.</p>
