<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Dugong</b> <br/>also called sea cow</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Dugong dugon</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 13 feet (4 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1,980 pounds (900 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Dugongs are sea mammals. They have a solid, streamlined, gray body with flippers instead of legs at the front, and a fluked tail. Dugongs have poor eyesight, and use the whiskers on the underside of their mouth and chin to feel along the seabed for plants and sea grasses. Instead of teeth, the dugong uses thick, horny plates inside its mouth to grind up the tough vegetation. They are usually found in small herds, but can also live alone.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Shallow seawater throughout the Indian and Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Gulf  </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for 13&#8211;14 months and give birth to a single calf. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 70 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The dugong has long been hunted for its meat, skin, and oil. These slow-moving animals were easy targets in shallow waters and their numbers fell. More recently, coastal developments for tourism and industry have damaged or cleared the sea grass beds on which the dugongs feed, for example along the coast of Queensland, Australia. Dugongs have died in fishing nets, too, and been injured in collisions with boats.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The dugong is listed on CITES Appendix I so international trade in dugong products is banned. It is also protected in many countries, such as Australia and Madagascar. There are a number of dugong protection areas along Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and speed restrictions for boats, so fewer dugongs are injured, and there are more controls on fishing nets. Researchers in Australia have caught and radio-tagged a number of dugongs that they followed for several months in order to learn more about their movements and where they feed. Dugongs play an important role in coastal marine ecosystems, and the status of dugong populations in an area can be used to monitor how well the ecosystem is doing.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The name sea cow refers to the fact that dugongs graze on sea grass, which forms meadows in sheltered coastal waters. As the animals feed, whole plants are uprooted and a tell-tale feeding trail is left behind.</p>
