<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Wandering albatross</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Diomedea exulans</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3.5 feet (1.1 meters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 11.5 feet (3.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 25 pounds (11.4 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The wandering albatross has the largest wingspan of any bird. Their wings are black but their body feathers are white with a black tail tip, they have a pink, hooked bill and webbed feet. They spend most of their time at sea only coming onto land to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. Albatrosses mate for life. They travel huge distances each year, often covering 600 miles (960 kilometers) in just one day.    They feed by landing on the surface of the ocean and fishing for small fish, cuttlefish, and squid. They also follow fishing boats for days at a time.</p>


<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 27,000 </p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Southern oceans, from Antarctic Circle to Australia, South Africa and South America</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 9&#8211;11 years old. They lay a single egg that both parents incubate for about 2 months. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Between 80 and 85 years  </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Many albatrosses die at sea each year when they become caught on fishing hooks. Tuna fishermen put out long lines of up to 65 miles (105 kilometers) in length, each carrying thousands of baited hooks. Albatrosses dive for the bait before it sinks and get entangled on the hook and drown. Others pick up plastic trash floating in the water, mistaking it for food. Some even feed this waste to their chicks. One survey on Bird Island, South Georgia (Antarctica), revealed that half the chicks had eaten hooks or plastic. There are problems on some of the nesting sites with introduced rats that eat their eggs, and with rabbits that build burrows where the albatrosses traditionally nest. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Bird Life International is campaigning for fishermen to fish in a "bird safe" way. Lines can be set at night, colorful streamers can be used on the lines to scare the birds away, and weights can be attached so that the lines sink quickly out of reach of the birds. Regulated fisheries, such as those around the Falklands and South Georgia, use these methods and very few birds are killed. Educating other fishermen is vitally important. Removing rats and rabbits from the nesting colonies is also crucial to the future survival of these amazing birds. </p>
