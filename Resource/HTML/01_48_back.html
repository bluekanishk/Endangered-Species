<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hairy-nosed wombat</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lasiorhinus kreffti (</i>Northern<i>) and Lasiorhinus latifrons (</i>Southern<i>)</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3 feet (1 meter)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 14 inches (35 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 77 pounds (35 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>There are two types of hairy-nosed wombat, the Northern and the Southern hairy-nosed wombats. The Northern species is one of the world's rarest mammals. Hairy-nosed wombats have a round stocky body, short legs, and a silky, soft, thick brown coat with dark patches around their eyes and short brown hairs on their snout. Their hairy noses distinguish them from their cousins, the common wombats, which have a bare nose. Wombats are marsupials and have a backward facing pouch&#8212;the opening faces their back legs. They have very strong front legs and long claws for digging burrows. Their burrow consists of many tunnels and openings. Although they are solitary animals, they may share a burrow. They have large, ridged teeth for grinding up their food of tough grasses. Their teeth never stop growing. The Southern wombat is slightly smaller than the Northern, and has more reddish fur.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 113 northern hairy-nosed wombats; Southern, unknown </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered (Northern) and Least Concern (Southern)</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Northern hairy-nosed wombats are found in eucalyptus woodlands and semi-arid, sandy grasslands in Queensland, Australia. The Southern species is found in similar habitats in South Australia and parts of Western Australia. </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females start to breed at around 3 years. They are pregnant for about 21 days and have 1 young that stays in the pouch for 8 to 9 months. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Wombats, especially the northern hairy-nosed wombat, have suffered from serious habitat loss to farmland, and are experiencing greater competition for food from grazing livestock. This competition is particularly bad during times of drought when the wombats cannot get access to water because of fenced farmland. They are also killed by dingoes, dogs, and feral cats, and many are killed on roads. Large numbers of the wombats have died from a disease called mange that is caused by microscopic biting mites that burrow in their skin. Mange is an introduced disease, so wombats have no natural tolerance to it. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1971, the Epping Forest National Park in Queensland was established to protect the remaining Northern hairy-nosed wombats. This recovery project involves studying the wombats in order to learn more about their numbers and behavior, removing cattle from their areas, and controlling the numbers of predators. A captive breeding program is also planned with the aim of establishing a second population of wombats in Southern Queensland. Plans to help the Southern hairy-nosed wombat include the protection of their burrows on farmland, and an effort to raise awareness of the threats to the wombat through education programs. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Wombats get their name from the Aboriginal word "wombach." Early European settlers in Australia nicknamed them badgers, because they lived in burrows and came out at night. </p>
