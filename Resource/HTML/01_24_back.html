<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Brown hyena</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Hyaena brunnea</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 121 pounds (55 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Although hyenas look like dogs, they are actually more closely related to the cat family. Brown hyenas have long, shaggy, brown coats, long legs with light brown fur and dark brown markings, a sloping back, and a short, brown tail. They have powerful jaws and teeth that can crunch through bones, and unlike most other mammals they can digest skin and bone. Brown hyenas are scavengers and will eat prey that has already been killed (carrion). They rest during the day and at night roam a huge area in search of carcasses on which to feed. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect a carcass over 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. When the hyenas are threatened they can make the hair on their body stand on end so they look twice their size. They live in small family groups but forage alone.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Semi-desert and woodland savannas of Southwest Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 5 years old. They are pregnant for 3 months and give birth to 3 cubs. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Many farmers have hunted and killed the brown hyena because they do not like these animals on their land, even though they are unlikely to kill their livestock. Diamond mining and the spread of tourism along the coastal strip of the Namib Desert in Namibia, Africa, also threaten their future. Brown hyenas living along this coastal strip rely on seals for much of their food, preying on seal pups and feeding on dead seals washed up on the beach. Anything that disturbs the seal colonies along the coast could have a knock-on effect on the hyenas.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly little is known about the brown hyena so organizations, such as the Brown Hyena Research Project, are using remote cameras and radio tagging to study the animals. They hope to find out how far they range, what food they eat, and which other predators they compete with. There are a number of national parks in Southern Africa that protect the brown hyena, such as the Sperrgebiet National Park in Namibia. Education is important to help farmers and local people understand that this hyena is not a threat to their animals and their livelihoods.</p>
