<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Coconut crab</b> also known as the robber crab</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Birgus latro</i></p>




<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3 feet (1 meter) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6.6 pounds (3 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These crabs can grow to huge sizes making them one of the word's biggest crabs. Coconut crabs have a purple-blue to orange-red body with brown markings. They have long, thick, strong legs, and large, powerful claws that can crack open a coconut so they can eat the flesh inside. During the day, the crabs rest in burrows out of the sun, and they search for food, such as fruit, seeds, leaves and nuts, at night. These crabs cannot swim and will drown in water.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Data deficient</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rocky and sandy coastlines, mangrove forests on islands in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay fertilized eggs in the ocean where they float for about 28 days while the baby crabs develop. When they have developed a hard outer shell-like skin the young crabs come onto land. </p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Over 40 years</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The huge coconut crab is considered a delicacy and is being overhunted. Numbers have fallen and in many places this crab is now rare. Other threats include the loss of coastal habitats, such as mangrove forests, due to the building of tourist resorts and new marinas. It is also eaten by introduced predators, such as rats and pigs.  </p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are controls on hunting in some parts of the coconut crab's range, for example in Papua New Guinea. In others, such as Vanuatu, small crabs may not be caught, or they may not be caught during the breeding season. Unfortunately, little is known about this crab so more research is needed. There have been campaigns to ban the crab from restaurant menus and this has reduced the market for the crabmeat. There are plans to establish nature reserves to protect the most important parts of the crab's habitat and to breed the crabs in captivity. </p>
