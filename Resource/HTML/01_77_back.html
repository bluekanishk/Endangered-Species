<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Quoll</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific names:</b> <i>Dasyurus albopunctatus</i> (New Guinea Quoll); <i>Dasyurus geoffroii</i> (Western Quoll); <i>Dasyurus hallucatus</i> (Northern Quoll); <i>Dasyurus maculatus</i> (Spotted-tailed Quoll); <i>Dasyurus Spartacus</i> (Bronze Quoll); <i>Dasyurus viverrinus</i> (Eastern Quoll)</p>

<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3 feet (91 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 15.5 pounds (7 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>There are six species of quoll and all are on the IUCN Red List. The quoll is a small marsupial and has a reddish-brown coat covered in white patches, a pointed face, small, upright ears, short legs, and a long tail. It lives alone and comes out at night to hunt small mammals, such as possums and rats, insects, reptiles, and birds. It is a really fierce hunter with razor-sharp teeth. It hunts on the ground as well as in trees. Quolls communicate using several different noises, from hisses and cries to screams. The spotted-tailed quoll makes a sound similar to a circular saw and is the largest of all the species.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered (Northern Quoll); Near threatened (New Guinea Quoll, Western Quoll, Spotted-tailed Quoll, Bronze Quoll, Eastern Quoll)</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>The Bronze and New Guinea quolls are found on New Guinea, the other species are found in thick eucalyptus forests in Australia and Tasmania</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1 year old. They are pregnant for 21 days and give birth to an average of 5 young that suckle in the mother's pouch for around 3 months. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 3&#8211;4 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>All species of quoll have suffered from a serious loss of their habitat, such as eucalyptus forests, which have been logged for timber, farmland, and settlements. Foxes, feral dogs, and cats have also killed many quolls. Poultry keepers kill them because the quolls attack chickens. In some places, quolls have died after eating poison bait put down for other predators, such as foxes and dingoes. The Northern Quoll has disappeared from much of its range in Northern Australia due to the spread of the cane toad. Quolls eat amphibians, but they do not know that this introduced species is poisonous, so many quolls have died after trying to eat cane toads. As the cane toads extend their range, many more quolls are being poisoned. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>All species of quoll have been given protection. However, more research is needed to understand the needs of quolls. In areas where their habitat has been fragmented, wildlife corridors can be established. Another way to help them is to make sure quolls cannot reach poison bait. Removing the cane toad will help the Northern Quoll. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>One university research project is teaching quolls to avoid eating cane toads. Female quolls are caught and kept in captivity for up to 8 months. The quolls are given cane toad sausages that contain just enough poison to make the quolls feel ill but not enough to kill them. They learn to avoid this taste! Then the quolls are released back into the wild. Hopefully these females will teach their young to avoid cane toads. </p>
