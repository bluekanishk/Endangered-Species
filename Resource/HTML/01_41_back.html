<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Giant panda</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 355 pounds (160 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>A member of the bear family, the giant panda has a large, round body, short legs, and a large, round head. Its fur is white with black markings on its ears, eyes, legs, and around its middle. It has pseudo-thumbs to grasp its favorite food, bamboo. About 99 percent of the panda's diet is bamboo, and it eats up to 40 percent of its weight in bamboo every day, but pandas will occasionally eat small rodents. Adults live alone. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Fewer than 2,500 in the wild</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Bamboo forests in the isolated mountain regions of west and southwest China </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 6 years old. They are pregnant for 3&#8211;5 months and give birth to a single cub. They have a cub about once every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 15&#8211;20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The major threats to the giant panda are the loss of its habitat and the bamboo that makes up almost all of its diet. The ever-increasing growth and spread of the human population in China has resulted in forests being cleared to make way for new farmland, roads, reservoirs, and mining. Because the remaining forests are shrinking, it is difficult for pandas to move from one area to another and so they are becoming isolated in smaller areas of forest. In some regions, the bamboo is dying because of pollution, which is leading to food shortages, but nobody is sure why. Some pandas are poached or become trapped in snares put down to catch other types of bears.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Logging inside the panda's habitat was banned in 1998, and the Chinese government has increased the number of reserves in China from 4 to 62 in the past decade to protect the pandas. There is also large-scale forest replanting. Organizations such as the WWF are working with the Chinese government to study the panda in the wild and establish wildlife corridors that link the panda forests. Education is important, and local people are being shown how to manage the forests sustainably to protect the panda as well as to give people an income. Ecotourism is providing local people with employment. As a result of these activities the number of pandas in the wild is slowly increasing. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>A newborn panda is all white. It is only about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) long, and weighs 3&#8211;5 ounces (85&#8211;141 grams), and has short, sparse, white hairs. Black patches start to appear on its skin when it is about a week old, and these gradually develop into the familiar black fur patches around the panda's eyes and on its body.</p>
