		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>Hammerheads are large sharks with a hammer-shaped head that has an eye and a nostril at the end of each extension. Their skin is dark greeny-gray in color, with a pale underside, and they have a large dorsal fin in the middle of their back. Their strangely shaped head is thought to make them more sensitive to the electrical signals that help them to capture prey. They live alone, but come together in large numbers to breed. Hammerheads feed on other smaller sharks, squid, bony fish, rays, and other animals that live near the bottom of the ocean.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Unknown</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Endangered</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>Shallow reefs and tropical oceans of the world. Hammerheads have been seen in water less than 3 feet (1 meter) deep.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Females are pregnant for 11 months and give birth to 20&#8211;40 live pups. </p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>About 20&#8211;30 years</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>The hammerhead population, like other sharks, is suffering from overfishing. Large sharks are caught simply for their fins, which are used in shark fin soup, a popular dish in Asia. The rest of the body is tossed back into the water and the sharks die. Many hammerheads are caught in drift nets and long lines put out to catch other species of fish, such as tuna. Hammerheads are slow-growing and take many years to reproduce, so renewing the population takes a long time. Today, so many hammerheads are being killed that their population is falling rapidly, especially in the Pacific Ocean.  </p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>The key to the survival of the hammerhead is to ban shark-finning. Many countries have already banned the practice, including Australia and Brazil, and U.S. Conservation organizations are running campaigns to educate the public about shark-finning, and to encourage people never to eat shark-fin soup. Managing the remaining hammerhead population is difficult as the species is found around the world. An international agreement is needed so that fishing quotas can be established, and protection given to the areas where the young sharks live for the first few years of their life. This will increase the survival of young sharks, so they can replace the adults that have been fished.  </p>
