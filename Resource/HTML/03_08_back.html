<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hawksbill turtle</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i></p>





<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2.7 feet (85 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 165 pounds (75 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These turtles have a flatish shell, or carapace, that has a pattern of amber, yellow, and brown. They have a large, hooked beak. They eat mainly sponges, but also squid, anemones, and shrimp. Females return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs. The females haul themselves onto the beach, dig a hole in the sand, lay their eggs, and cover them before returning to the ocean. The newly hatched turtles race to the ocean, but predators, such as seabirds, lizards, and crabs, kill many of the hatchlings before they reach the water.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 22,900 nesting females</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Shallow clear reefs, lagoons, estuaries, and bays, and sandy beaches for nesting in tropical waters around the world</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are between 20&#8211;40 years old. They nest between 3&#8211;6 times per season, and lay 100&#8211;140 eggs in each nest. The eggs incubate in the ground for about 60 days. Less than 1 hatchling in a 1,000 may reach adulthood. Females breed every 2 to 4 years.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 30&#8211;50 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Over the last 100 years, millions of turtles have been killed for their shell, which is sold as tortoiseshell, or bekko, a highly desired shell, which is used for jewellery and ornamental objects. Despite protection, there is still considerable illegal trade. The turtles are killed for their meat too, and fishermen use the meat to bait their hooks and crab traps. Also, turtle eggs are collected and sold as a delicacy. Another threat comes from the loss of their nesting beaches due to tourism and coastal development. Many are killed when they become tangled in fishing nets.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>By 1975, the number of hawksbill turtles had fallen by 80 percent, and it was listed on CITES Appendix I to stop the international trade in tortoiseshell. However, CITES does not prevent trade within countries and today this trade still threatens the turtle, while some Japanese dealers continue to import illegal stocks of shell. Some of the most important nesting sites are protected, for example those found in the Great Barrier Reef National Park, Australia.</p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>When the hatchlings reach the water they start a "swimming frenzy" in which they swim as fast as possible to get away from the dangers of shallow water. This lasts several days, until they reach the safety of the open sea. The young turtles spend the next 10 years or so at sea, but scientists do not know where they go or what they do. It's still a mystery. </p>
