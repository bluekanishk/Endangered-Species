<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Kern Plateau slender salamander</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Batrachoseps robustus</i></p>



<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>:  up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b>  not recorded</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This is a rusty brown-gray colored salamander with a dark stripe down its back and spots. It has a broad head, long legs, and short tail. There are four toes on the front and hind feet. It is a type of lungless salamander, and breathes through its skin. This means it has a moist skin and has to live in damp places. These salamanders do not live in water, but are found close to water. They emerge from their hiding places under logs on damp nights to hunt for insects and other small invertebrates. Often they will lie in wait for prey animals to pass close by, leaping forward to catch them with their long, sticky tongue. The salamanders stay underground when the temperatures fall below 5<sup>o</sup>Centigrade or if the ground is dry. </p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Several thousand</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near Threatened</p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Near rivers and streams on the wooded slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, at altitudes of about 6,500 feet (1,980 meters)</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females lay their eggs on land rather than in water. The eggs hatch into tiny salamanders that look just like their parents. They do not go through a tadpole stage.</p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The first Kern Plateau slender salamanders were found in 1972 but they were wrongly identified. It was not until 2002 that the species was formally identified. These salamanders are found in fewer than 40 woodland sites in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The threats come from any loss or change to their habitat. Even small changes can have severe effects, for example, the capping of a stream to extract spring water for bottling or domestic use could reduce the flow of water, while a new road could alter the path of a stream. Natural events are a threat too, such as flash floods that wash the salamanders away, or fires that destroy areas of woodland.  </p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>This salamander is a protected species. All but a few of the sites where the salamanders have been recorded are found on land managed by the USDA Forest Service or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. </p>
