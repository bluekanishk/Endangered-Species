<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Kihansi spray toad</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Nectophrynoides asperginis</i></p>




<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>:  up to 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b>  up to 0.10 ounces (3 grams)</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This small, golden toad needs damp surroundings in order to thrive. It has a huge appetite, feeding on a range of insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates. Unlike most toads, the female gives birth to live young. She is fertilized internally by the male and then retains her eggs within her body. The eggs develop into tiny toadlets. </p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>None</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Extinct in the wild</p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Once found within the Kihansi Gorge under the Kihansi Falls on the Kihansi River in the Udzungwa Mountains, east Tanzania, Africa</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females give birth to between 5 and 20 tiny toadlets, each the size of a pinhead.</p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This species was only named in 1999, at the time when a dam was being built in Tanzania, on the Kihansi River above the Kihansi Falls. Between 1999 and 2003, thousands of toads were seen in the gorge under the waterfalls, in some years as many as 20,000. The spray from the waterfall created a damp habitat, which suited the toads. But when the dam was completed, the volume of water flowing over the falls fell by as much as 90 percent. As less water came over the falls, so there was less spray, and the habitat dried up. A huge sprinkler system was built to spray the area artificially, but it was too late for the toads. The few that survived were killed by a fungal disease. The last sighting of a toad in the wild was May 2005.</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 2001, the Bronx Zoo moved 500 toads from the Kihansi Gorge to the U.S., where they were kept in six different zoos. This saved the species from extinction. At first, the captive breeding schemes were unsuccessful and many of the toads died. But as the zoos learned more about the toad's requirements and breeding, they became more successful. There are now about 5,000 toads in captivity. Back at the Kihansi Falls, the sprinkler system is still in place and this helps to create a mist, especially during the dry season. The vegetation is recovering and, in 2010, 100 toads were flown to a state-of-the-art captive breeding center in Tanzania. It is hoped that the toads will be reintroduced to the wild in the near future.  </p>

<p class="wow amp"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The Kihansi spray toad gets its name from where it lived in East Africa. It was only found in a gorge where the air was full of mist or spray from a waterfall, keeping everything covered in a thin film of water.</p>
