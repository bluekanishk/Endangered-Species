<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Golden jackal</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Canis aureus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (162 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 1.6 feet (50 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 33 pounds (15 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These jackals have a brown to gold colored short coat, a slim body, long slim legs, a bushy tail, and big ears. They are the only jackals that have a black tip on their tail. These jackals eat carrion, or they will hunt birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and lizards, and eat fruit. Often they are chased away from their food by larger animals, such as lions, so they swallow it quickly. Females can regurgitate their food for their young. Jackals live in pairs and the pairs often hunt together. The young stay with their parents for up to two years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry forests and open ground across North and East Africa, the Middle East, southeast Europe and south Asia. </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 11 months old. They are pregnant for 63 days and give birth to up to 9 pups. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 8 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The golden jackal is considered a pest in many countries because it attacks small livestock, such as chickens and lambs, and damages fruit crops especially grapes and melons. In some countries, thousands of these animals were shot or poisoned each year by farmers protecting their livestock and in special programs to control rabies. In addition, the jackal was hunted for its fur until the Second World War. More recently, jackal numbers have declined due to the loss of its habitat to farmland and industry, and from disease transmitted by feral dogs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Golden jackals are protected across much of their range, and many populations live in national parks and other protected areas, such as the Serengeti and Maasai Mara National Parks in Tanzania and Kenya. There are ongoing studies on these animals in the Bhal and Kutch areas of India, and also in Banglasdesh. However, more research is needed as little is known about the behavior of these animals, especially those living in Asia. </p>
