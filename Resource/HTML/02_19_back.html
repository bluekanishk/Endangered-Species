<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Steller's sea eagle</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Haliaeetus pelagicus</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3 feet (0.9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 8 feet (2.40 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These large, powerful eagles have black feathers on their head and body, with white feathers on their wings, legs and tail, a deep yellow bill, and yellow feet with long, sharp, black talons. These eagles dive down from the trees and snatch up fish from the water in their talons, or stand in shallow water and take fish as they swim by. They also feed on the bodies of dead animals, such as seals. Not much is known about Steller's sea eagles as their habitat is very remote. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Found on cliffs along the coasts, lakes, and rivers near forests in eastern Russia. They spend the winter on the Japanese islands of Kuril and Hokkaido</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 4&#8211;5 years old. They lay between 1&#8211;3 eggs that are incubated for 38&#8211;45 days. Mostly, only 1 chick hatches.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The threats to Steller's sea eagles in Russia include the loss of their coastal breeding grounds to industrial developments and hydroelectric schemes. There has been extensive logging of the forests, too. In the past, the use of DDT as a pesticide lead to a fall in their number, as DDT caused their eggs to have thin shells and to break easily. The eagles prey on fish near the surface of water, especially salmon, but overfishing has reduced the number of salmon available, and eagles in Japan have been forced to look for other sources of food. The birds have been seen feeding on the dead bodies of deer that have been shot, and this leaves them vulnerable to poisoning from lead shot. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>This sea eagle is protected across its range and international trade in its feathers and eggs is banned. Many of its breeding grounds in Russia and overwintering grounds in Japan are protected. Tagging programs have followed the migration of young birds from Russia to Japan, and this is providing researchers with more information about their routes, requirements, and survival needs.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Steller's sea eagles build huge nests from twigs in trees or on cliff ledges. The eagles use the same nest each year and continually add twigs so it grows larger and larger. Some of the biggest nests are up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) thick and 8 feet (2.5 meters) wide. </p>
