<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Gharial</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Gaviali gangeticus</i></p>



<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 23 feet (7 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 2,200 pounds (977 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gharials have the same body shape as crocodiles, but with a long, thin snout. The male has a knobbly growth on the end of his snout called a "ghara" in Hindu, which means "pot." Gharials cannot move very well on land but they are excellent swimmers, and have a strong tail and webbed back feet. They have around 110 teeth that they use to snatch up small fish. They live in deep, fast-moving rivers, but bask and lay their eggs on the riverbanks. During the winter, gharials hibernate at the bottom of rivers where it is warmest, and come to the surface occasionally to breathe.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 200</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rivers of India and Nepal</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 8&#8211;9 feet (2.7 meters) long, which is usually when they are over 7 years old. They lay up to 60 eggs and the hatchlings emerge after 2&#8211;3 months. </p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>In the past, gharials were hunted for their skin, while their body parts were used in traditional medicines in Asia. There is less hunting today, but there are other threats to their future survival. The most serious are the loss of their habitat, water pollution, and overfishing. Gharials nest on banks near rivers, but clearance and disturbance of these nest sites has lead to a drop in gharial numbers in many areas. Gharials are often killed in fishing nets, while overfishing means there are too few fish left in the rivers for the gharials to eat.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Most of the remaining gharials live in protected areas where their nest sites are safe from disturbance. There has been a captive breeding program since the late 1970s, and more than 5,000 young gharials have been released into the rivers. However, despite this huge effort, numbers have not increased in the wild. Now, conservation projects are focusing on teaching local people how they can benefit from the survival of the gharial, and finding alternative jobs for local fishermen. </p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>No one knows what the ghara (the round growth on the end of the snout) is for, but scientists believe it is used to make a buzzing noise, and may also be used by males to blow bubbles to attract females.</p>
