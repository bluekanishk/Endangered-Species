<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Quokka</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Setonix brachyurus</i></p>






<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 36 inches (90 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 9 pounds (4 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These marsupials look like small kangaroos. They have short brown hair and lighter colored hair on their fronts. They have a stocky body, small head, and a short tail. Their strong back legs mean they can climb trees and hop. Quokkas live in small family groups and squabble over shelter in hot weather. They sleep during the day and hunt at night. They eat grasses, leaves, berries, and fruit. They swallow their food whole and then regurgitate it to chew over later.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 10,000 on Rottnest Island</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry desert and wet forests in southwestern Australia, but mainly Rottnest Island off Perth, West Australia.</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1 year old. They are pregnant for 4 weeks and give birth to 1 joey. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 5 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are three main threats to the survival of the quokka&#8212;habitat loss, hunting by animals, and tourism. Their habitat has been lost, particularly along the western coast of Australia, where tourist developments have meant the clearance of swamps, swamp forest, and thick coastal vegetation. In addition, the decrease in rainfall in southwest Western Australia has lead to the drying out of swamps. Many quokkas are killed by introduced predators, such as the dingo, red fox, and domestic dog. Others have died on roads and in forest fires.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Quokkas are protected in Australia. Many are found on Rottnest and Bald Islands where predators are controlled. However, Rottnest Island is a tourist destination and more than half a million people visit each year and this is thought to be changing the quokkas patterns of behavior. Quokkas also occur in a number of protected areas on the mainland of Western Australia, including Stirling Range National Park and Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Perth Zoo has a breeding group of quokkas. </p>
