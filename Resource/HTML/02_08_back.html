<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Harpy eagle</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Harpia harpyja</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 40 inches (1 meter)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan:</b> up to 7 feet (2 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up 20 pounds (10 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>One of the largest eagles, an adult female harpy eagle is about half the size of an average human adult. They have dark gray feathers on their back and pale feathers on their underside. They have mid-gray head feathers, and a double crest of feathers on the very top of their head. They hunt small, tree-living animals such as monkeys, sloths, and opposums. They can fly at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour). Living among trees, harpies have a short wingspan and use trees for cover when attacking prey. Harpy eagles mate for life.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical forests of Central and northern South America</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay 2 eggs that are incubated for between 52&#8211;56 days. When one egg has hatched the other is ignored. They raise one chick every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25&#8211;45 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The harpy eagle is a top predator and a breeding pair of birds needs about 7.5 square miles (20 square kilometers) of rain forest to survive. The harpy eagle has suffered from the destruction of its rain forest habitat and has almost disappeared from Central America and northern South America. Another threat is poaching. Hunters shoot them for food and to supply feathers to shamans (spiritual healers).</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The best way to conserve the remaining harpy eagles is to protect their habitat. However, young eagles can fly long distances and leave protected areas, so legal protection for the birds and its enforcement is needed all the way across their range. In Panama, the government has named the harpy eagle the country's national bird and it is hoped that this will boost conservation efforts. The Peregrine Trust has a successful captive breeding program and young birds have been released back into the wild in Panama and Belize. Educating people about why it is vital to save the eagles and the benefits they bring is important, too, especially in the communities around the release sites.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Harpy eagles are very patient when hunting. They sit perfectly still on a branch watching for prey for many hours. Once spotted, they dive down and grab their prey in their powerful, curved talons.</p>
