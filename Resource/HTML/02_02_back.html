<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>African penguin</b> <br/>also called jackass penguin</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Spheniscus demersus</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2 feet (60 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 7 pounds (31 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These medium-sized penguins have black head and back feathers, and a white front with black markings. They also have red patches around each eye. They have small, flightless wings like flippers, and webbed feet. They are called jackass penguins because of the loud, braying call that they make, like a donkey. These penguins live in big colonies. They eat mainly sardines and anchovies. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 52,000</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Coastline and rocky islands around Namibia and South Africa</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4&#8211;6 years old. They lay 2 eggs that are incubated by both parents. The eggs hatch after about 40 days.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;15 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Millions of penguins were once found along the coast of Southern Africa, but today they number just a few thousand. Their eggs were collected and their breeding areas were destroyed by people collecting guano (bird droppings), which was used as a fertilizer. This no longer takes place but there are still serious threats. Overfishing has reduced the availability of fish for the penguins to feed on, and there is greater competition for food from other animals, such as seals. Oil spills are another threat. A recent spill affected more than 40 percent of this species of penguins. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>All of the breeding areas in South Africa are protected, and the collection of eggs is illegal. Dyer Island, off the coast of South Africa, is a key breeding area, but there are not many suitable places left for the birds to dig their nesting burrows, so they end up nesting in the open where survival of the chicks is poor. Conservationists have put out artificial "igloos" that the birds can nest in. Another group is helping to raise chicks that have been abandoned by their parents. Normally the chicks would die, but they are looked after until they are strong enough to survive on their own.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>African penguins molt every year between November and January, which means their old feathers fall out and are replaced with new ones. The new feathers help to keep them warm. While they are molting they cannot swim, so they have a big feed in the weeks leading up to the molt.  </p>
