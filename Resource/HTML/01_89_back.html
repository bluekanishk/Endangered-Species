<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Southern elephant seal</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Mirounga leonina</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2 feet (6 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 8,155 pounds (3,700 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The biggest of all the seals, elephant seals have a large, solid body, a short neck, and a broad head. Their thick skin is a silvery-gray to brown in color. The males have a short trunk-like nose that curves over the top of their heads. They make their trunk bigger to attract females during mating. Southern elephant seals are amazing divers. They can dive as deep as 6,998 feet (2,133 meters), and dives of up to 120 minutes have been recorded. They spend 70 to 80 percent of their lives underwater, and eat crustaceans, squid, and fish.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 600,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Oceans around Argentina, New Zealand, and sub-Antarctic islands</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4 years old. They are pregnant for 11 months and give birth to a single pup. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Both the northern and southern elephant seals were hunted for oil, which was obtained from the thick layers of blubber under their skin. Hunting almost wiped out both types of seal, but small groups survived and bred. By the 1960s, the populations had recovered dramatically. However, since then numbers have been in decline, in some places by as much as 90 percent, and scientists are not sure why.  This may be linked to overfishing, which is reducing the amount of food available for the seals, or it could be due to climate change. Also, some seals have been found entangled in fishing nets.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The southern elephant seal is protected under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and it is listed on CITES Appendix II. More research is needed to learn about the seals' behavior, for example what are their migratory routes, and do the adults and juveniles feed in the same places and depths. Some seals have been caught and tagged so that their movements can be tracked. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Between November and April elephant seals stay on land for 3 weeks to molt. During this time they lose all their old skin and hair. They don't eat and become a rusty brown color from lying in their own excrement.</p>
