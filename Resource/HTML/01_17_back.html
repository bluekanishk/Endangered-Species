<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Beluga whale</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 17 feet (5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 3,300 pounds (1,500 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These small whales have a round body, a domed head, and smooth, white skin. Belugas are toothed whales and have 10 cone-shaped teeth on each side of their upper and lower jaw. They use their teeth to grab their prey and then swallow it whole. They eat fish, squid, crustaceans, and octopus. Belugas are very sociable animals and live in groups called pods. They are nicknamed "sea canaries" because they make lots of different sounds, including whistles, clicks, squeals, chirps, and clangs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 40,000&#8211;80,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Arctic and sub-Arctic oceans</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 7&#8211;9 years old. They are pregnant for 14&#8211;15 months and give birth to a single calf. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Beluga whales were hunted for hundreds of years for their meat, oil, and skin, and this reduced their numbers considerably. Their fat was used to oil watches and machinery. The current threats to this species are different, but are still linked to humans. Some beluga migration routes take them close to coastal industrial areas that pour a lot of waste into the water. The belugas have built up these pollutants in their bodies and they are killing the adults and causing birth defects in the calves. Global warming is another threat to their survival. The change in weather patterns is likely to affect the sea ice and this may reduce the amount of food available. Some belugas are still caught in the wild for the aquarium trade.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The international ban on commercial whaling saved belugas, and now only local people, such as the Inuit, are allowed to hunt them. In Alaska and Canada there are better controls over what waste can be dumped into the oceans to make sure the belugas do not come into contact with pollutants. In 2011, a large area of Cook Inlet in Alaska was designated critical to the survival of the Cook Inlet beluga whale and, as a result, there will be limited development of industries that could harm belugas, such as oil drilling.</p>
