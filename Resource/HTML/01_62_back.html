<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Maned wolf</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Chrysocyon brachyurus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Shoulder height:</b> up to 2.5 feet (78 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 53 pounds (24 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The maned wolf has a gold-red coat, a long lean body, long slender legs, and a long pointed muzzle. It has a short bushy tail and a short mane of black hair on its neck and shoulders&#8212;this mane hair stands upright if the wolf is threatened. The wolf's long legs help it to see above the tall grasses of its habitat, and, as a result, it has been called "a fox on stilts." The maned wolf rests during the day, and hunts between dusk and dawn. It eats a lot of fruit, such as bananas and guavas, but also small mammals such as rabbits, and rodents, birds, lizards, frogs, and snails. This wolf is solitary, unlike other wolves that live and hunt in packs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 13,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tall grasslands, scrubby forests, and swamps in eastern and central South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They give birth to 1&#8211;5 pups. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 15 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This wolf once hunted on the grasslands of South America, especially the cerrado (a region of open woodland and tropical savanna) of Brazil. Much of this grassland is now used for cattle ranching, or has been ploughed for crops. Only one-fifth of the cerrado remains, and the numbers of maned wolves have fallen dramatically. Also, many of these wolves are killed on roads, and some die from diseases carried by pet dogs. Maned wolves do attack poultry, and as they come into closer contact with people they are more likely to be killed by farmers protecting their animals.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The maned wolf is listed on CITES Appendix II, and is classed as endangered in Argentina and threatened in Brazil. Many maned wolves are found in protected areas. Although hunting is illegal across much of its range, the law is difficult to enforce in remote regions. Speed limits have been put in place on roads near to protected areas where maned wolves are known to live. There are several hundred maned wolves in captivity, but they have not bred well until recently. Changes to their diet to include more fruit and less meat have resulted in more cubs.  </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Although called a wolf, the maned wolf is not a true wolf. It is not related to foxes either. It is placed in a group on its own because it is different from wolves, dogs, and foxes.</p>
