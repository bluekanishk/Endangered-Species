<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bush hyrax</b> <br/>also called Bruce's yellow-spotted rock hyrax</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Heterohyrax brucei</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 12 inches (31 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Hyraxes are small, round animals with short, reddish-brown fur. Their feet are specially adapted with "rubbery" undersides to help them climb rocks and trees. These small mammals live in groups of up to 50 individuals in holes and crevices in rocks. The group consists of one male, and females and their young. They bask in the sun during the day, and huddle together at night to keep warm. As the heat of the day fades, the bush hyrax goes on short forages to feed on grasses, fruit, small insects, lizards, and birds' eggs. They make a lot of different noises to communicate with each other, including squealing, shrieking, growling, twittering, and screeching.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry savanna and rain forests in East Africa and the northern parts of Southern Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 16 months old. They are pregnant for 7 months and give birth to 2&#8211;3 young.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Although bush hyraxes are abundant across East Africa, their numbers in Southern Africa are much smaller. The hyrax is hunted in some areas, but the main threats to its future come from habitat loss and drought. Research has found that numbers fall during times of drought. The severe drought that affected parts of East Africa in 2008&#8211;2009 is likely to have reduced numbers of the bush hyrax quite significantly. In the past, the hyrax has become locally extinct after droughts.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>As the bush hyrax is still abundant across much of its range, there are no specific programs in place to aid its conservation. However, if drought becomes more commonplace, then this species could disappear from parts of its range. </p>
