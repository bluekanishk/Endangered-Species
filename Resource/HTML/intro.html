	Around the world, every day, hundreds of species of animals are becoming endangered, and many are almost extinct in the wild. This matters, because although there is still a lot we need to understand about the delicate ecosystems and food chains that connect our world, one thing we do know is that by damaging one link or losing one species, we harm the whole chain.<br/><br/>
	Just as important is the enormous pleasure and excitement, amazement and sense of awe that animals give us, from dazzling sea corals to the majestic animals of the African plains.

<h1 class="glo">WHY ARE ANIMALS ENDANGERED?</h1>
<h3>Habitat destruction</h3>
<p>This is probably the main threat facing most animals. As the human population increases and spreads, so does the demand for space for more farmland, industry, settlements, and roads. Of greatest concern is the massive destruction of the world's tropical rain forests that are home to more than half of the world's animal species. Today, more rain forests than ever are being cleared. The northern forests are disappearing too, grasslands are being ploughed up, and wetlands drained. Even the coral reefs are suffering from the effects of pollution and tourism.</p>
<h3>Habitat fragmentation</h3>
<p>Habitat loss often leads to fragmentation, when small parcels of an environment become separated from each other as a result of human disturbance and the development of land. This makes it difficult for the animals living there to move from one fragment to the next, and many species are more likely to die out. One way to improve this situation is to create wildlife corridors that link the fragments and provide safe passageways for animals to move about within their original habitat. </p>
<h3>Poaching</h3>
<p>Poaching is the illegal killing of an animal for their meat and body parts, such as bones, fur, and horns. The poaching of animals, such as elephants, rhinos, and tigers, almost wiped them out, but they are now protected. However, the body parts of these animals are still very valuable. Local people living in poverty can earn a lot of money by killing the animals. Protecting vulnerable species by moving them to conservation sites is one solution, but many animals stray away from protected areas. Another way is educating local people about the benefits of protecting their wildlife, for example they can earn money from ecotourism or sustainable forestry. If a forest is completely felled or burnt, only a few people make money. But if a local forest is kept alive and managed sustainably, the harvests of wood, fruits, and nuts, and other forestry products, are controlled so that many future generations of local people will be able to benefit.</p>
<h3>Bushmeat</h3>
<p>Many wild animals are killed for their meat, for example deer that are hunted in Europe and North America. In most places, the level of hunting does not threaten the survival of animals. However, the hunting of wild animals for bushmeat in tropical regions of the world, especially Central Africa and parts of Asia, is increasing and putting many species at great risk, for example gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees. </p>
<h3>Global warming</h3>
<p>Global warming is the gradual increase in temperature of the Earth's surface. It is caused by an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases&#8212;the gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and methane. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they trap more heat and the surface temperature of the Earth increases. The main cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas, and coal. Deforestation is another contributor. Living forests take up carbon dioxide, but when they are burnt they release it.</p>
<p>As temperatures increase, so sea levels rise. This is caused by more ice melting at the poles. In the Arctic and Antarctic the melting ice is threatening the survival of many animals, such as the polar bear. Rising sea levels are also threatening to flood low-lying areas, especially tropical islands where sea turtles are losing their nesting sites on the beaches. Coral reefs are threatened, too, as the corals are particularly sensitive to the slightest rise in sea temperature.</p>
<p>There are also shifts and changes in weather patterns, with more extreme weather becoming common, for example flooding, powerful hurricanes, and drought.</p>
<p>Global warming can be tackled, but it has to be done on an international scale, one country alone cannot stop it. Countries have to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by burning fewer fossil fuels, and using more renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, and hydro or water power. The replanting of forests and the planting new forests will help, too, as trees take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Timber is a renewable fuel, so long as the trees that are felled are replaced with new ones.</p>
<h1 class="glo">RED LIST</h1>
<p>The Red List is a huge list of almost 60,000 species that has been put together by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Each species on the list has been assessed by scientists&#8212;they have looked at how many individuals of each species are left, if the numbers are increasing or decreasing, and what threats they face. Then each species is placed in one of the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>extinct</li>
<li>extinct in the wild</li>
<li>critically endangered</li>
<li>endangered</li>
<li>vulnerable</li>
<li>near threatened</li>
<li>least concern</li>
<li>data deficient</li></ul>
<p>A species that is placed in the critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable categories is considered to be "at risk" of becoming extinct. The list is revised every few years. Sadly, one third of all the species on the list have been placed in one of the "at risk" categories&#8212;that's almost 20,000 species at risk of becoming extinct. They include some of the world's best-known animals, such as the tiger, giant panda, blue whale, and the polar bear. </p>
<p>Some of the animals listed in this app are in the least concern category, but if their habitats continue to be lost they too could become endangered, so action needs to be taken now. </p>
<h1 class="glo">CITES</h1>
<p>CITES stands for Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. It is an agreement between 175 countries. </p>
<p>Each year thousands of live animals and plants, and products made from them, are traded around the world. This trade is worth billions of dollars. In the 1960s, conservationists were worried that the trade could result in too many animals being killed or plants being collected from the wild. CITES was formed to control this trade, especially the trade in species that were endangered. </p>
<p>About 5,000 species of animal and 29,000 species of plant are protected by CITES. They are placed on one of three lists: Appendix I, II, and III.  </p>
<p><b class="colored">Appendix I</b> gives the highest level of protection. Species listed here are at risk of extinction so trade is not allowed. There are 625 species of animal and 301 species of plant on the list. For example, the cheetah, giant panda, gorilla, and leatherback turtle. </p>
<p><b class="colored">Appendix II</b> lists animals and plants that are at risk of becoming endangered, and so trade is carefully controlled, usually in the form of permits and licenses. There are 4,685 species of animal, and 29,105 species of plant on Appendix II. For example, the shoebill, king cobra, and great white shark.</p>
<p><b class="colored">Appendix III</b> lists species that are given protection in at least one country, and that country has asked other countries to help control the trade. There are 147 species of animal and 119 species of plant on this list. For example, the golden jackal in India, and the Cape stag beetle in South Africa. </p>
