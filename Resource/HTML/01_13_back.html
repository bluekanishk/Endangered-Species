<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Aye-aye</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Daubentonia madagascariensis</i></p>






<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Body length</b>: up to 14.5 inches (37 centimeters)  </p>
<p><b>Tail length</b>: up to 21 inches (53 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6.6 pounds (3 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This strange-looking primate was originally classified as a rodent but is really a mammal. Aye-ayes have a small, pale, pointed face, large, round, orange to yellow eyes, and big ears. Their thick fur is dark gray to dark brown in color, and they have a long, bushy tail. The aye-aye is the largest nocturnal primate. It has four long, thin bony fingers on each hand with long, curved claw-like nails. The middle finger is longer than the others and is used to pull out the grubs and insect from trees, and the insides from fruits, such as coconuts. Aye-ayes are shy and live alone in trees. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical rain forest, dry scrub forest, and coconut plantations only in Madagascar</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for 5&#8211;6 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 3 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 24 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>For a long time, the aye-aye was killed because the Malagasy people thought it was a bringer of bad luck, and that it represented death and evil. Over the last 50 years, much of its rain forest habitat has been cleared for timber, fuel, farmland, and to make way for new settlements. Aye-ayes numbers are slow to recover because the females nurse their single baby for up to two years.   </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The key to saving the aye-ayes is to protect the remaining forests where it lives. Some of the aye-ayes are found in national parks, such as Ranomafana National Park (in southeastern Madagascar), but others live in unprotected areas. During the 1990s, six aye-ayes were captured and taken to the Durrell Zoo on the island of Jersey where they have bred well. There are other captive breeding centers, which are also helping to ensure the survival of this species. Durrell Zoo has trained some students from Madagascar so they can work on conservation projects. Education is vital, because the aye-ayes cannot be successfully reintroduced without the support of local communities. A protective reserve for aye-ayes has now been established on Nosy Mangabe, an island off the northeast coast of Madagascar.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>To find food the aye-aye taps on branches with its middle finger. If there is a hollow sound the aye-aye uses its supersensitive hearing to listen for the sounds of insects or larvae moving under the surface. If it hears any noise, it rips open the branch with its large, front teeth and then uses its long, middle finger to scoop out the food.</p>
