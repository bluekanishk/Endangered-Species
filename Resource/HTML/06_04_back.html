<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Edible sea urchin</b> also known as the common sea urchin</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Echinus esculentus</i></p>




<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Diameter</b>: up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) </p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Sea urchins belong to a group of animals called echinoderms-spiny skinned animals that include starfish. Sea urchins have a round shell, or skeleton case, called a test, which surrounds their soft body. The test of the edible sea urchin is pinky-red and covered in sharp spines. The sea urchin has a mouth with teeth on the underside of its test. It has tube-like "feet" with which it moves along the sea floor, and uses its teeth to feed on seaweed and small shellfish. The edible part of the sea urchin is the soft body inside the shell.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Clings to rocks in shallow and deep water around Britain and northwest Europe</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1&#8211;3 years. The males eject sperm into the water that fertilizes the eggs released by the female. Fertilized eggs develop into a larva that swims freely in the water. The larva looks very different from the adult. After about 8 weeks the larva settles down and grows into an adult sea urchin.</p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;16 years</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The edible sea urchin is much in demand as a luxury food around the world. The edible parts include the reproductive organs, and the eggs, known as the roe. This demand has caused a massive increase in the harvesting or collection of urchins. In some places the sea urchins are harvested from the seabed using trawls that damage cold-water reefs. As a result of over-harvesting, the animal is now under threat of extinction in many places. Sea urchins play an important role in coastal food chains, and their removal affects other animals</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The best way to tackle the threat of over-harvesting is to regulate the number of urchins that can be harvested, so that there are enough sea urchins left to reproduce and maintain the population. This is called sustainable harvesting. There are plans to farm sea urchins, so the wild stocks can be protected</p>

<p class="wow inv"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Although urchins are less popular as a food in Europe, people pay a lot of money to eat them in other parts of the world. For example, in South Africa just 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of urchin roe (eggs) can cost $50 (&#163;35).  </p>
