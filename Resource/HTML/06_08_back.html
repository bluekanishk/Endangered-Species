<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Staghorn coral</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Acropora cervicornis</i></p>

<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The staghorn is one of the fastest-growing corals. A coral is formed from a colony or group of soft-bodied animals called polyps that live together. Each polyp builds a hard covering around itself for protection. This coral gets its name from its appearance, which looks like deer antlers or stag horns. The polyps feed on food that drifts by, such as algae and tiny animals.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Reefs in the Caribbean, southern Gulf of Mexico, Florida's east coast, and South America   </p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Staghorn corals reproduce mainly when branches drop off and grow into new colonies. Once a year, the coral polyps spawn, releasing eggs and sperm into the water. The eggs are fertilized and form larvae. The larvae drift in the ocean for a few days, and then settle on a coral reef and grow into a new colony.</p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10 years</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threats to staghorn corals are global warming, destruction of the coral reefs, and water pollution. Global warming is causing the sea temperatures to increase, and this causes corals to bleach (they turn white as a result of losing their zooxanthellae, the tiny algae that live in the coral and provide it with food). Without zooxanthellae, the coral starves. Staghorn corals are also susceptible to disease, such as white-band disease, that has killed lots of corals. In many areas, corals are collected for souvenirs, or destroyed to provide building materials for making walls, or damaged by boat anchors and natural events, such as hurricanes. Water pollution too, especially sewage, harms corals. </p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>All corals, including staghorn coral, are listed on CITES Appendix I, and in U.S. waters it is illegal to collect corals for commercial use. In some areas, artificial reefs have been established to encourage corals to grow, and in others there have been attempts to re-attach damaged staghorn corals after hurricanes. Some staghorn corals are over-predated by animals, such as the crown of thorns starfish, and predators can be removed by hand or caught in traps to protect the corals.  </p>
