<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Blue whale</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Balaenoptera musculus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 110 feet (33.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 209 tons (190 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These giants of the ocean have a long, streamlined body and a broad, flatish head. They look blue under water but their coloring is actually silver-gray. The blue whale is the largest animal to have ever lived in the ocean or on land. It is about the size of a Boeing 737 airplane, and its heart is roughly the size of a small automobile. They feed on krill from the ocean, which they filter through baleen plates. They have 300&#8211;400 of these plates on each side of the mouth, and about 90 throat grooves that run from the mouth to the middle of the body. These grooves allow the whale to expand its mouth and throat to gulp in huge mouthfuls of food and water. The blow-hole, or nostril, on the top of its head can blow a spout of air up to 29.5 feet (9 meters) high. Most blue whales live alone or with one other blue whale. They can remain underwater for up to an hour, reaching depths of 350 feet (105 meters).</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 10,000&#8211;25,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>All deep oceans, except the Arctic</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 7&#8211;10 years old. They are pregnant for 10&#8211;11 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Average 80&#8211;90 years but 110 years has been recorded</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Blue whales were heavily hunted between 1860 and 1930, when the development of the harpoon gun made it possible for whalers to catch these huge animals more easily. They were on the verge of extinction when whaling was banned in 1966. However, blue whales still face a number of threats including water pollution, overfishing of the krill on which they feed, collisions with boats, or being injured in drift nets and other types of fishing net. Another threat is increasing noise pollution&#8212;the loud sounds created by propellers, engines, and other machinery in the water, make it difficult for the whales to communicate with each other.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The blue whale is a protected species and is listed on CITES Appendix I. It is found around the world, so countries have to work together to save it. There are a number of marine sanctuaries where the whales are known to give birth to their calves, and there are whale sanctuaries around Antarctica. However, there are many more critical areas that need protection, such as the coast of Chile where blue whales are known to gather with their young. More research is needed on the behavior of the whale and its movements, in order to establish new protection areas.</p>
