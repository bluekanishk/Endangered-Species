<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Spotted owl</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Strix occidentalis</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 19 inches (48 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 3.5 feet (9 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1.5 pounds (0.6 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This medium-sized owl has brown feathers with white spots. The baby owls are born with white, fluffy feathers and only develop their spots as they get older. Spotted owls hunt at night and feed on small mammals, such as mice, rabbits, hares, and flying squirrels. They prefer to nest in holes in trees, and live in forests that are at least 200 years old where there are many old and dead trees that they can use. There are three subspecies of spotted owl, the northern spotted owl, the California spotted owl, and the Mexican spotted owl. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 15,000</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Thick forests along the Pacific Coast states, southwestern U.S., and central Mexico</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2&#8211;3 years old. They lay 2&#8211;4 eggs, which are incubated for about 30 days. </p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 17 years </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The numbers of spotted owls are declining across their range, but most at risk is the northern spotted owl that is found from Canada to California. Vast stretches of old growth forest have been felled for timber and, as a result, the owls have lost their nesting sites and food supply. Although the forests are being replanted, the young forests lack the large trees, and rich mix of plants and animals found in old growth forests. Forest fires, storms, and severe winters have also killed many owls. However, a new threat has come from the barred owl. The barred owl, another native species, is moving into the habitat of the spotted owl and competing with it for food and nest sites.  </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The main aim of conservationists has been to protect the old growth forests. The Northwest Forest Plan was drawn up during the 1990s and is currently being reviewed. This is a management plan for more than 24 million acres of forest in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California, where the felling of old growth forests is banned. The area includes six national parks, such as Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park, and 19 national forests. Also, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified large stretches of forest in the southwestern U.S. as "critical habitat for the owl", so it cannot be felled or developed. However, despite forest protection, the number of owls is still falling. There are proposals to remove the barred owls to see if this will help to stop the decline in spotted owls.  </p>
