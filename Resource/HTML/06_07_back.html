<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Mexican redknee tarantula</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Brachypelma smithi</i></p>




<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5.5 inches (14 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 0.7 ounces (19.8 grams)</p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The Mexican redknee tarantula is venomous but will only attack when threatened. It has a dark brown, hairy body and legs, with orange to red patches on the knees. The redknee usually lives in a burrow in the ground, or under rocks and thick vegetation. The ends of its 8 legs are highly sensitive and can pick up vibrations, smells, and tastes, which the spider uses to track down prey. It hunts at night by lying in wait for unsuspecting animals, such as insects, frogs, lizards, and mice. Once caught, the spider bites its prey with its fangs and injects them with venom. Spiders are unable to digest their food internally so they inject digestive juices into the body of their prey. This turns it into mush and the spiders then suck up the mush.  </p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry, rocky, and sandy deserts, scrubland, and dry and warm forests along the Pacific coast of Mexico</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 6&#8211;7 years old. After mating, the female carries both eggs and sperm in her body. She makes a nest of silk and lays hundreds of eggs and sperm. The eggs fertilize within minutes, and the spiderlings hatch about 3 months later. </p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Females up to 30 years, males die about a year after they mature, aged about 5 years.</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The Mexican redknee tarantula is a popular pet spider because it is colorful, quiet, and easy to handle. Thousands were collected from the wild each year and sold into the pet trade. This was stopped in 1985, when it was noticed that the spiders were getting smaller. All the older, larger spiders had been caught. Since that time, the main threat to the redknee's survival in the wild has been the loss of its habitat and people. People fear spiders, especially large ones, and many tarantulas are killed each year, usually by having petrol poured down their burrows and set alight.</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1985, the Mexican redknee tarantula was added to CITES Appendix II so the pet trade was controlled. Today, the spider breeds well in captivity, so there is no need to catch wild spiders. Unfortunately, little is known about this tarantula in the wild. </p>
