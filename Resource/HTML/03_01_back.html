<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>American crocodile</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Crocodylus acutus</i></p>



<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 23 feet (7 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 992 pounds (450 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The American crocodile has a metal gray scaly skin, with a paler underside. Like all crocodiles it is superbly suited for life in the water. Its eyes, ears, and nostrils are on the top of its head so it can submerge the whole of its body with just the top of its head showing above the water line. The crocodile can close its windpipe so that it can breathe underwater, and a special throat flap allows it to catch prey and eat it underwater without choking. Its ears have a flap of skin and its eyes have a third eyelid to protect them under the water. Fish are their main diet but they will also eat birds and small mammals.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 10,000&#8211;20,000</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Fresh and saltwater, but mainly tropical water in southern U.S., Central America, and northern South America</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females make a nest either in a hole or on a mound of mud or sand. They lay between 30 and 60 eggs that incubate for about 90 days. Both male and female guard the eggs and care for the young.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 55&#8211;70 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>In the past, American crocodiles were hunted for their skin, which was made into luxury leather goods. Today, the main threats come from the loss of their wetland habitat, illegal hunting, and capture for commercial crocodile farms. Many wetlands have been drained to make way for farmland and new tourist developments, and crocodiles have also been killed by boats and on roads. Low-lying areas are threatened by global warming, which is causing sea levels to rise and saltwater to flow into wetland areas. Although crocodiles can tolerate salt water, they cannot survive in salt water permanently.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>American crocodiles are listed on CITES Appendix I, so international trade in their skin is banned. Research is being carried out to learn more about the behavior of these crocodiles, and how they are affected by changes in sea levels. Researchers have fitted some crocodiles with satellite units so that they can follow their movements. A number of American crocodiles are in crocodile farms and it is possible that some of these animals will be used to re-establish the species into areas where it was once found.</p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The American crocodile takes any prey that it catches into water to eat. It will even regurgitate small amounts of food into the water to act as a lure to attract fish.</p>
