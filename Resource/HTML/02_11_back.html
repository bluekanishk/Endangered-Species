<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hyacinth macaw</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus</i></p>



<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3.5 feet (1 meter) </p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 60 inches (152 centimeters)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The largest of all the species of parrots, hyacinth macaws have vivid blue feathers and bright yellow circles around their eyes and by their bill. They are sociable and noisy, making loud screeching and croaking sounds. They live in groups of 20&#8211;30 birds, and pairs usually mate for life. They have incredibly strong beaks to crack open hard-shelled nuts and seeds, and they also eat fruit, flowers, and small insects.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 6,500</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical rain forests of Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 7 years old. They lay 1&#8211;2 eggs that hatch after about 29 days. Usually only 1 egg hatches. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown; in captivity 25&#8211;40 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The last 40 years have seen a massive fall in the numbers of hyacinth macaws. This is mainly as a result of illegal trapping of the birds to sell to private collectors. As many as 10,000 birds may have been caught in the 1980s alone. Illegal trapping continues today, with birds fetching up to $25,000 (about &#163;15,800) each. As well as trapping, these birds have suffered from the loss of their habitat.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Two-thirds of the remaining hyacinth macaw population are found in the Pantanal region of Brazil. Thanks to the work of the Hyacinth Macaw Project, numbers have increased from 1,500 in the mid 1990s, to more than 5,000 today. Research found that there was a shortage of suitable nest sites, so experts constructed artificial nesting sites. Ecotourism is encouraging local people to protect the macaws. There are also a number of captive breeding programs, which are successfully breeding macaws to be released back into the wild. </p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Hyacinth macaws like to visit riverbanks where they eat clay. It is thought that the clay helps to remove any poisons that they have taken in from the fruits and nuts that they eat, and it stops them from getting an upset stomach. </p>
