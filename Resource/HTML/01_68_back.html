<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Okapi</b> <br/>also called the bush giraffe</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Okapia johnstoni</i></p>






<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 5.5 feet (1.6 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 550 pounds (250 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Okapis look like a cross between a horse and a zebra. They have a velvety brown coat with a white head, white stripy legs, and white stripes on their hind quarters. They live in dark, tropical forests and have poor sight, but a good sense of smell and hearing. They are secretive and live alone, apart from mothers with young. They eat fruit, leaves, and grasses.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 10,000&#8211;20,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Thick forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 14 or 15 months and give birth to a single young. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Okapis are only found in the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has been devastated by a civil war for more than 30 years. There has been extensive logging in the country, much of it uncontrolled. Okapis do not like disturbance, and when human settlements are set up around the fringes of a forest, the okapis move deeper into the trees. These animals are also hunted for their meat and skin. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Okapis are a protected species, but enforcing protection laws is difficult in inaccessible parts of the country. The animals are found in a number of protected areas, including the Okapi Faunal Reserve (a natural World Heritage Site), and the Maiko National Park. Yet despite the protection, okapis and other animals are still threatened by illegal hunting and logging, as well as loss of habitat due to settlements. Organizations such as the Okapi Conservation Project have funded wardens and rangers to provide protection. There are also hopes to reintroduce okapis in parts of their former range, including Uganda's Semliki Forest National Park.</p>
