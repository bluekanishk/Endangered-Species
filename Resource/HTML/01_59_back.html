<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Leopards may be the smallest of the big cats but they have the most beautiful coat with black and brown spots on a golden-yellow background. The color varies a lot depending on where the leopards live. The dark markings are caused by a substance found in the skin called melanin. This is the same substance that makes human skin turn brown in the sun. Leopards have long, sensitive whiskers that help them to feel their way through the jungle at night. They also have long hairs in their eyebrows that help to protect their eyes against the undergrowth in the jungle. Leopards hunt mammals, such as antelope as well as lizards and birds</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Leopard skin was once highly desirable and very fashionable, and this resulted in thousands of leopards being killed in the name of fashion. This trade has now stopped, but some leopards are poached so their skin can be used in certain traditional African ceremonies. However, the biggest threat to their survival comes from their conflict with humans. As more of their habitat is lost to farming, so leopards are coming into greater contact with people, especially farmers, who shoot, trap, and poison them to protect their livestock. In Asia the greatest threat comes from the loss of their forest habitat. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The leopard is a protected species in most of the countries across its range. It is also listed on CITES so international trade is strictly controlled. Many of these animals live in national parks and other reserves where they are protected. Leopards are popular animals and national parks with leopards attract a lot of tourists, which brings income into the local community. In some countries, such as Namibia, conservation organizations are working with farmers to find ways of protecting their livestock from leopards. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>If it makes a big kill, a leopard is strong enough to drag some of the meat into the branches of a tree. This means that it can be left out of the reach of scavengers, such as hyenas.  </p>
