<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Black-and-white ruffed lemur</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Varecia variegata</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4 feet (120 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The black-and-white ruffed lemur is one of the largest of the lemur species. It has mainly white fur with black patches, long limbs, and a long, bushy tail. It has large, round, yellow eyes, and a distinctive ruff of fur around its head and neck. Lemurs live in noisy groups. They spend most of their time in trees, and use their hands, feet, and tail to travel from tree to tree. As well as eating fruit, seeds, and leaves, these lemurs use their slim snouts and long tongues to reach the nectar inside flowers. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Less than 10,000 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rainforests in Madagascar</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2 years old. They are pregnant for 3&#8211;4 months and give birth to 2&#8211;3 young. They breed every year. They make breeding nests high in the trees (60&#8211;80 feet/18&#8211;24 meters), but the young often fall out and are killed or badly injured.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20&#8211;25 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The numbers of these lemurs have fallen by more than 80 percent since the early 1980s. This is mostly due to the loss of their forest habitat, which has been cleared as a result of logging for timber, or burnt to make way for farmland, mining, and new settlements. This lemur does not like disturbance and as soon as people move into the rain forest, the lemur moves deeper into the trees. It is a large animal that is easy to spot in its habitat, so it has been heavily hunted for meat, which attracts a high price. It is also hunted by birds of prey, boa constrictors, and the fossa&#8212;a cat-like mammal and top predator found only in Madagascar.</p>
 
<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are a number of rain forest national parks on Madagascar, and in the last 10 years this lemur has disappeared from some of them, although conservationists are not sure why. Hunting continues, despite laws making it illegal, so an education program is urgently needed. This lemur is part of a number of successful captive breeding programs, for example in Durrell Zoo on the island of Jersey, and Duke University Primate Center in North Carolina. However, efforts to reintroduce the lemur to areas where it once lived have not been successful. There are concerns that there are too few rain forests left for the numbers of this lemur to recover.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Lemurs howl and make loud alarm calls that sound like barks that can be heard nearly half a mile (1 kilometer) through the forests where they live. Sadly, this makes them easier for people to hunt. </p>
