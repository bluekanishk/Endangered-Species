<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Cassowary</b> </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Casuarius bennetti (</i>Dwarf<i>), Casuarius casuarius (</i>Southern<i>), Casuarius unappendiculatus (</i>Northern<i>)</i></p>





<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height:</b> Up to 6 feet (1.8 meters)  </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 130 pounds (59 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Cassowaries are large, flightless birds that are related to emus. The largest species, the southern cassowary, has a round, black, feathered body with a bright blue neck and red skin under the throat. The crest-like casque on their head is thought to protect the bird's head from falling fruits and vegetation as they push through their rain forest habitat. Cassowaries have thick, short, powerful legs and large feet. The inner toe on each foot ends in a long claw that they use for fighting. Cassowaries are secretive birds that live alone. The females are bigger and more brightly colored than the males. These birds are generally slow movers, but they can run fast to escape predators. They eat fallen fruit and vegetation. </p>
 
<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,500 Southern, as many as 10,000 Northern, and unknown numbers of Dwarf</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable (Southern and Northern), Near threatened (Dwarf)</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>The Dwarf and Northern cassowaries are found in the rain forests of New Guinea. The Southern cassowary is found in the south of New Guinea, and in Queensland, northeastern Australia</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay between 3&#8211;5 eggs, which are raised by the male. The male cares for the young for up to 16 months.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 50 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main cause for the decline in the numbers of this unusual bird is habitat loss. More than 80 percent of its coastal lowland habitat has been lost and the rest is very fragmented. Huge tracts of rain forest have been cleared to make way for farmland and new developments along the coast of Queensland. In some places the forest fragments are so small that the birds don't have enough fruit trees from which to feed. Many are killed on the roads or chased by dogs. Cassowaries in New Guinea are hunted for food.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Most of the larger areas of rain forest in Queensland are now protected. There are plans to monitor the birds and to identify key areas where they live. Wildlife corridors will be established to link forest fragments. </p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Cassowaries have a digestive system that allows them to pass seeds undamaged from the fruits they eat. As a result, these birds are vital to the future growth of the rain forests because they disperse the seeds of more than 150 species of plants. Over 100 different tree and shrub species might disappear if the cassowary becomes extinct. This makes them a "keystone species" in seed dispersal. </p>
