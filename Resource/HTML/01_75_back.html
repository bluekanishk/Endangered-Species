<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Pygmy hippopotamus</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Choeropsis liberiensis</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 35.5 inches (90 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 605 pounds (275 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The pygmy hippo looks very similar to its bigger cousin, but it is much smaller; just one fifth the weight and half the height. It has a round, solid body, a thick neck, a tiny tail, and short legs. The pygmy hippo is very shy and prefers to live alone. During the day, it rests in a river or in a riverbank burrow made by another animal. At night it feeds on fruits, roots, leaves, and grasses, using its thick lips rather than teeth to pull them up.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 3,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Swamps and rivers in forests in West Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4&#8211;5 years old. They are pregnant for 6&#8211;7 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 42 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Over the last 30 years the habitat of the pygmy hippo has been reduced considerably as a result of deforestation for farming and settlements. The remaining forests are fragmented, and groups of pygmy hippos have become isolated. Some pygmy hippos have been killed for bushmeat. Civil wars in their range have resulted in large numbers of human refugees who have cleared the forests to make camps, and killed the wildlife for food.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The pygmy hippo is listed on CITES Appendix II and is protected across its range, but often the laws are not enforced and pygmy hippos are killed. There are a few protected forests where these hippos survive, such as Sapo National Forest in Liberia. However, there is a lot of illegal logging taking place, even in protected areas. More research is needed to learn about the behavior of this shy animal. Fortunately, there are a number of pygmy hippos in captive breeding programs where they are breeding quite successfully, including San Diego Zoo in the U.S., Johannesburg Zoo in South Africa, and London Zoo in the UK.</p>
