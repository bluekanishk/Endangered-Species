<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Northern leopard frog</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lithobates pipiens</i></p>



<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 inches (13 centimetres) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 3 ounces (80 grams)</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These little frogs are greenish brown in color, with a white underside. They get their name from the dark spots on their back and legs. The pattern of spots is different on each individual. Northern leopard frogs hibernate during the cold months at the bottom of ice-covered muddy ponds. They eat beetles, moths, butterflies, snakes, wasps, bees, and other frogs. The females are slightly bigger than the males.</p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Ponds, marshes, bogs, and lakes in southern Canada and northern North America</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 to 2 years old. The female lays a clutch of about 3,000 eggs. Once the male has fertilized the eggs, they hatch after 3 or 4 months.</p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 2&#8211;4 years</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The number of northern leopard frogs has decreased steadily since the 1970s, especially in the western United States. Acid rain caused by air pollution was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, and this damaged the frogs' eggs. Frogs have a permeable skin that allows chemicals to pass through. This means they are very sensitive to pesticides and industrial waste in the water. They have suffered from the loss of their wetland habitats, predation from introduced species, such as the rainbow trout and bullfrog, and now global warming is another threat to their survival. </p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>One of the most important ways of conserving this frog is by protecting its breeding ponds. However, many of their most important ponds are not protected by the law. The removal of any introduced predators from the ponds leads to greater survival of the tadpoles. The careful use of pesticides near the ponds helps to reduce water pollution. In some areas, water that runs out of old mining sites contains dangerously high levels of harmful pollutants, so there needs to be more regulation of mining activities. Leopard frogs migrate from their winter sites to their breeding ponds each year, so wildlife corridors are being established to protect them during their migration. A number of research projects are underway across North America, including those organized by the Calgary Zoo in Alberta, Canada. </p>

<p class="wow amp"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>These frogs eat almost anything that they can fit in their mouth. They sit still and wait for prey animals to pass close by and then they leap forward to grab it with their sticky tongue.</p>
