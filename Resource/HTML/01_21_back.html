<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These wild cats have brown fur with black spots, with longer hair that forms a type of ruff around their face, and pointed ears with black and white markings. They are called bobcats because of their short "bob" tail. They hunt rabbits and hares by sitting at burrow entrances and waiting for the prey to appear, or they will stalk and ambush prey such as deer. They hunt mainly at night and rest during the day. Bobcats live alone.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 725,000&#8211;1,020,000 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Deserts, grasslands, swamps, and forests from Canada through North America to Mexico</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1 year old. They are pregnant for 63 days and give birth to between 3&#8211;6 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 12&#8211;13 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The fur of the bobcat is much in demand, especially its spotted belly fur, and for this reason they have been heavily hunted. Bobcat and lynx together make up half the legally traded market in small-cat furs. In addition, bobcats are often shot by ranchers and farmers who want to protect their livestock. The bobcat is also threatened from the loss of its forest habitat and the fragmentation of the forest.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The bobcat is listed on CITES Appendix II so the trade in its fur is regulated. It has been given total protection in 10 U.S. states and hunting is regulated in the rest, as well as in Canada. In Mexico, the bobcat is listed as endangered and hunting is controlled. Conservation organizations have carried out a number of studies, including the radio tracking of collared individuals to learn more about their behavior and the type of habitat that needs to be conserved to ensure the bobcat's survival. A number of bobcats are kept in captivity but they do not breed well.</p>
