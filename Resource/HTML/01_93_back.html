<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Sumatran serow</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Capricornis sumatraensis</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 37 inches (94 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 309 pounds (140 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The Sumatran serow belongs to a group of animals called goat-antelopes. It has a rough black or brown coat with a shaggy mane and long, pointed ears. Both males and females have two small, dagger-like horns on top of their head that they use in defense. Serows usually live alone, but sometimes several can be seen together in one place. They eat grass, shoots, and leaves.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rocky areas and wet forests throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, and southern Thailand</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 30 months old. They are pregnant for 7 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There has been widespread deforestation of tropical forests across the Sumatran serow's range for timber, farmland, and new settlements. New roads have opened up large areas of forest that were once inaccessible to humans. Mining is also a threat in Malaysia. In addition, the serow is hunted for its meat, skin, and for various body parts, such as its horns, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. Some are killed in traps put out for other animals. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The serow is listed on CITES Appendix I so there is no international trade in its body parts. It is also a protected species across its range. It is found in some national parks and other protected areas, but often the animals in these areas are not protected from poaching. There are some serows in captivity where they have been breeding successfully. </p>
