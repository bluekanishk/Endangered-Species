<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Crested gecko</b> <br/>also called eyelash gecko </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Rhacodactylus ciliatus</i></p>




<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) </p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Crested geckos have the nickname eyelash geckos because of a row of tiny, soft spines that grows across the top of their eyes (like eyelashes) and down their back. They have a golden-yellow scaly skin. Their tail helps them to make long-distance jumps from branch to branch. In the wild, most crested geckos lose their tail when they are quite young and the tail does not grow back. Crested geckoes are nocturnal and come out at night to hunt for fruit and small insects.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests of New Caledonia (in the Southwest Pacific near Australia)</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 9&#8211;12 months old. They usually lay 2 eggs that hatch after 55&#8211;75 days.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The crested gecko was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1994 on Grand Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Today, it is found in two small areas of New Caledonia where a lot of logging is taking place to clear land for farming and new settlements. The crested gecko is also hunted by rats. Another threat comes from an introduced species of ant, the little fire ant, or electric ant. This is an aggressive insect with a painful sting for its size. It attacks geckos, and other animals on the forest floor, and can cause nasty injuries and even death. Crested geckos are also caught illegally in the wild and sold as pets.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Crested geckos are a protected species, but more needs to be done to conserve their forest habitat. Some crested geckos are found in one protected rain forest, Parc Provincial de la Rivi&#232;re Bleue on Grand Terre in New Caledonia, but they do not occur in any of the other protected areas. Little is known about these geckos in the wild, but there are increasing numbers of crested geckos in captivity, as it is a popular pet reptile. </p>
