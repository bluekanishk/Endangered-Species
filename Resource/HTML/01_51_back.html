<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Honey badger</b> <br/>also called a ratel</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Mellivora capensis</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3.8 feet (98 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 15 inches (39 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 30 pounds (14 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These stocky animals have a long, sturdy body, short legs, a thick neck, and a short, bushy tail. Their skin is tough and loose, so that it can turn around to face an attacker that is holding it by the neck. The honey badger's skin is covered in short, dark brown, coarse fur. It also has a distinctive covering of gray and white hairs that spread from the top of its head, along its back, and down to the top of its tail. It has big feet and long claws for digging out small mammals, snakes, lizards, and insects such as termites. The honey badger likes honey and works with the honey guide bird to find beehives&#8212;the bird's song guides the honey badger to the hives. The honey badger breaks open the hive with its sharp claws and eats the honey, but it leaves the wax and larvae for the bird. The honey badger is mostly nocturnal, and its main predators are lions and leopards. The badgers live in burrows, often those abandoned by other animals, such as aardvarks.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Scrubland, savannas, and tropical rain forests throughout West Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabia, Pakistan, and India</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Nobody is sure of the length of time the females are pregnant. It is likely to be around 2&#8211;3 months. They give birth to a single cub. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 7&#8211;8 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Many honey badgers are trapped and killed each year, mostly by farmers wanting to protect their livestock and beehives. Others are trapped in snares put out for other animals, such as jackals. Honey is a valuable product and hives can bring in a good income for farmers, so they do not want honey badgers on their land threatening their bees. (In some regions, honey badgers destroy as many as 1 in every 10 hives.) Also, the badger's skin and claws are used in traditional medicines. In some countries, the badger is killed for bushmeat because of the decline in other animals. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Many honey badgers are found in national parks and other protected areas. The biggest threat to this animal comes from beekeepers, so conservation organizations are educating beekeepers about the best way to keep their hives safe. One simple solution to the problem is for beekeepers to hang their hives above the ground. This means the hives will be out of reach of the honey badgers and so the beekeepers will not need to shoot them. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The honey badger can spray a foul-smelling liquid from glands near its bottom. Scientists think they use this to put off enemies, but the badgers also spray the liquid into beehives to make the bees fly away, or make them sleepy before breaking open the hive. </p>
