<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Koala</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Phascolarctos cinereus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 2 feet (0.60 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 30 pounds (14 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Koalas are small, round marsupials with soft, gray and white fur, large, flat faces, and big ears. They have sharp claws, which help them to grip onto tree trunks. Female koalas have a backward facing pouch on their belly for their young. Koalas eat only the leaves of eucalyptus trees. They live in the trees and spend a lot of their time sleeping, waking at night to eat. They live alone. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Less than 100,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Eucalyptus forests in parts of south and eastern Australia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old, and after about 35 days give birth to a single baby koala, called a joey. The baby lives in its mother's pouch for 5&#8211;7 months, and then she carries it on her back. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 17 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Habitat loss is the major threat facing the koala. Their eucalyptus forests are being cleared for farmland, new roads, housing, and industry. In some areas, eucalyptus trees are suffering from dieback. Forest fires are becoming more commonplace, especially during drought years, and they can destroy huge areas of forest and kill many koalas. The lack of forests in some areas is leading to koala overcrowding and the over-eating of trees that remain. Overcrowding causes stress and more disease among the koalas. Each year, as many as 4,000 koalas are killed on the roads or by dogs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The best way to protect koalas is to conserve what is left of their habitat, and to replant eucalyptus forests that have been cut down. Areas of forest have shrunk and some individuals have become isolated from other koalas. The planting of wildlife corridors helps to link these forests. Speed limits on roads close to koala habitats can be lowered to reduce the number of deaths on the road. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Koalas are mainly nocturnal and can sleep for up to 18 hours a day. This is because they need a lot of energy to digest their diet of eucalyptus leaves, and sleeping is the best way to conserve energy.</p>
