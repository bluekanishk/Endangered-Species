<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Great raft spider</b> <br/>also called fen raft spider and fishing spider</p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Dolomedes plantarius</i></p>





<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Body Length</b>: up to 9 inches (22 centimeters) </p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These big spiders have a dark brown body with striking white stripes down each side, and white spots on their abdomen. Their long legs are covered in short water-resistant hairs, which means they can walk on water. These spiders sit on the water's edge with their front legs on the surface waiting for prey. When an insect alights on the surface of the water, the great raft can feel the ripples and darts forward to snatch up the prey. As well as insects, they also catch tadpoles and small fish. It is thought great raft spiders hibernate during the cold winter months.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Freshwater, such as marshes, ponds, and lakes, throughout Europe</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay hundreds of eggs in a silken sac that they carry around with them for up to three weeks. During this time the female finds a spot to build a web where she will place her eggs. The eggs hatch into spiderlings after 5&#8211;9 days.</p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 2&#8211;3 years</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to these spiders is the loss of their wetland habitat. This type of habitat, more than any other type, has experienced a steady decline as it has been drained and used as farmland. Water levels have fallen as water is used for irrigation.</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In the UK, the areas where the raft spider lives&#8212;Redgrave and Lopham Fen, Pevensey in Sussex, and near Swansea&#8212;are protected. Raft spiders need standing water all year round, and without it they die. For this reason new pools have been dug on the Redgrave and Lopham Fen to make sure that there is water all year round. Plans are in place to reintroduce the spiders to other locations. </p>
