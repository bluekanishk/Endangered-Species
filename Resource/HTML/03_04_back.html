<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Eastern diamond-backed rattlesnake</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Crotalus adamanteus</i></p>


<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 feet (2.4 meters))</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes are the largest of the rattlesnake species. They have a brown to gray scaly skin that has a large diamond pattern. They have a venomous bite that can kill humans, but their venom is used mainly to help them digest food rather than as a defense against enemies. These snakes hunt during the day&#8212;they lie motionless for hours and strike like lightning when prey passes. They eat birds, rats, mice, rabbits, and other small mammals. The rattle on the end of the snake's tail is made up of pieces of old skin. Each time a rattlesnake molts, a piece of skin is left behind and becomes part of the rattle, so the rattle gets longer. Young snakes don't have a rattle at all. The males are longer than the females. The snakes live solitary lives for much of the year, but share overwintering dens.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dray, sandy areas and dry forests along the southeast coast of the United States</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Rattlesnakes are live-bearers, which means the eggs are kept inside the female's body and she gives birth to live young. Females have 12&#8211;24 young, and they breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;20 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These snakes were once common across the southeastern states of the U.S., from Louisiana to Florida, and north to North Carolina. However, loss of their preferred habitat of open, pine woodland and scrub means that they are now considered endangered in several states. Many snakes are hunted each year for their meat and skin, and just for pleasure. In the states of Georgia and Alabama there are annual rounds-ups in which hunters find and kill as many snakes as possible. </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Eastern diamond-backed rattlesnakes occur in a number of national parks and other protected areas where they are safe from hunting. However, for those animals living outside the protected areas there is no national or state protection. Conservation organizations are hoping for quotas and other controls on hunting. The snakes often hide in gopher or tortoise burrows, and both these species are at risk from gassing, a technique also used to kill snakes in the burrows, and which is illegal in Georgia and Florida. </p>
