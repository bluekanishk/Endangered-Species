<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>African gray parrot</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Psittacus erithacus</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 16 inches (41 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan:</b> up to 20 inches (52 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1 pound (550 grams)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>African grays are small parrots with gray feathers, white eye patches, bright red tail feathers, and a large, curved, black beak. They are lively, intelligent birds that live in big, noisy flocks, screeching, whistling, shrieking, and squawking to one another, in flight or when resting. These parrots eat berries, seeds, palm nuts, and fruits. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Wooded savanna and forest areas of Western and Central Africa</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>African gray parrots mate for life. Females lay 3&#8211;5 eggs in a clutch, and the eggs hatch after 30 days. </p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 50 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are two main threats to this parrot. The first is the loss of its tropical rain forest habitat through logging. Parrots nest in the hollows of large, old trees and these are only found in older forests. The second threat is the pet trade. African gray parrots are popular pets and demand for these birds is increasing, especially in China. Between 1994 and 2003 an estimated 360,000 birds were caught and exported. The pet trade continues, and some authorities believe that up to 21 percent of the global population is caught every year, putting the survival of these parrots at great risk. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>International laws permit a certain level of trading in African gray parrots, but due to the severe decline in their numbers, it is hoped that the export quotas for some African countries will be reduced. It is illegal to import wild-caught African gray parrots into the United States and the European Union. Some African gray parrot populations are protected, for example those found in the Selonga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a World Heritage site, and the largest tropical rain forest reserve in Africa. Some conservation organizations rescue captured parrots and release them back into the wild.</p>
