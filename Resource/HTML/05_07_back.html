		<h2 class="fish">NAME</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Whale shark</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scientific name:</b>
			<i>Rhincodon typus</i>
		</p>
		<h2 class="fish">SIZE</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Length</b>: up to 59 feet (18 meters) </p>
		<p>
			<b>Weight:</b> up to 44,100 pounds (20,000 kilograms)</p>
		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>These huge sharks are the biggest fish in the world. Whale sharks have a massive, gray-green body covered in pale yellow spots and stripes, and a broad, flat head. They are filter feeders and open their wide mouths to suck in mainly plankton and small fish. They usually live alone, but large groups of a 100 or more have been seen. The females are ovoviviparous, which means the eggs are fertilized inside the females' body and they give birth to live young.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Unknown</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Vulnerable</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>All warm waters, except the Mediterranean Sea</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Females breed when they are about 30 years old. Although some females have been found with hundreds of pups, most give birth to about 12 young</p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>About 100&#8211;150 years</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>The whale shark was a popular catch for its meat, oil-rich liver, and large fins. Despite being protected in many countries, whale sharks are still caught. This shark swims slowly, often near the surface of the water, so it is frequently injured or killed in collisions with shipping and smaller boats. Others are killed when they become entangled in drift nets. Often whale sharks are harmed by swallowing plastic trash that is floating in the oceans. These sharks are very slow to mature and breed, so there is a greater risk that they will be killed before they have a chance to produce young.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>Surprisingly little is known about this shark&#8212;where it lives, how long it lives, and how many are left, so a lot more research is needed. The whale shark is listed by the Convention on Migratory Species, so it is protected when it swims through the waters of countries that have signed up to the agreement. It is also listed by CITES, so there is no international trade in its body parts, such as its fins. Countries such as Australia have protected important whale shark habitats and gathering places, for example, Ningaloo Marine Park (Western Australia) where large numbers of whale sharks gather every year. </p>
