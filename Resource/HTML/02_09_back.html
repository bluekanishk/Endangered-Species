<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hawaiian goose</b> <br/>also called the nene</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Branta sandvicensis</i></p>



<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 27 inches (69 centimeters)   </p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The nene is the national bird of Hawaii. It has a round body, long neck, and long legs. Its feathers are a black and cream color. Its long legs mean that it can walk, and that it doesn't "waddle" like other geese. Hawaiian geese eat grass and fruit. As they eat the geese make a soft "nay-nay" sound, which is why they are called a nene locally. Nenes mate for life.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 1,050&#8211;1,200</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable </p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Shrublands and lava flows throughout the islands of Hawaii</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay 1&#8211;5 eggs in a hollow on the ground. The eggs are incubated for 30 days before hatching.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 25 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>When Europeans first arrived in Hawaii over 300 years ago, there were an estimated 25,000 Hawaiian geese. They were easy birds to hunt because they spent a lot of time on land. Their eggs were collected, too. Animals such as cats and mongooses that were introduced to the islands preyed upon the birds, and rats ate the eggs. By 1951, hunting, predation, and habitat loss had reduced them to just 30 birds. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1950, Sir Peter Scott of the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust took some birds back to the Slimbridge wild bird sanctuary in England. The captive breeding program was so successful that 200 birds were released back into the wild in Hawaii in the 1960s. Since then, more have been released and now their population is about 1,000. The Hawaiian goose is a protected species and is no longer hunted. The Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been increased in size to manage the grassland habitats that are essential to the survival of these birds. However, they are still threatened by introduced predators, being hit by cars, and by habitat loss, as the human population in Hawaii increases.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The Hawaiian goose has partially clawed and partially webbed feet, unlike its close relative the Canada goose that has webbed feet. The claws give the goose a better grip when it walks over its rugged, rocky terrain. </p>
