<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Margay</b> <br/>also called the tree ocelot</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Leopardus wiedii</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 31 inches (79 centimeters)  </p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 18 inches (45 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 7 pounds (3 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Margays are small wild cats with a thick, yellowish-brown coat with a pattern of brown spots and stripes, and a long ringed tail. They hunt small mammals, birds, and insects. They are nocturnal and arboreal.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 10,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical forests of northern Mexico to northern Argentina</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 6&#8211;10 months old. They are pregnant for about 80 days and give birth to 1&#8211;2 young, called kittens. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Until the late 1980s, the margay was one of the most hunted of the wild cats for its fur. Poaching still continues, despite it being a protected species in most countries of Central and South America. However, the biggest threat comes from habitat loss. The tropical forests in which margays live are being cleared for farming, roads, and housing. These cats do not like disturbance, and they will not cross cleared areas or roads to find new areas of forest. As a result, they are being forced into smaller and smaller forest fragments. Some margays are caught for the pet trade. Margays only breed every few years and have small litters. The survival rate of kittens is just 50 percent, so their numbers are slow to recover. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The margay fur trade is illegal. Most of the conservation work is aimed at understanding more about these shy cats in order to better manage their forest habitats. There are a few margays in zoos and wildlife parks, but they are very secretive animals that do not breed well in captivity. Sadly, the number of margays continues to fall.</p>
