<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Marsh deer have a light, reddish-brown, shaggy coat, a long neck, and a small head with big ears. The males have long, forked antlers, which can grow up to 24 inches (60 centimeters) long. Their strong back legs are well-suited to jumping through water. Marsh deer live in pairs or small family groups. They stay hidden in the forest during the day, and come out in the evening to feed on grasses and plants in marshy areas. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Marshy grasslands and flood plains in central South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for 8 months and give birth to a single fawn. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The numbers of marsh deer have been dropping for 200 years or more. This began when cattle ranches started to take over their grassland habitats. Since then, more grassland has been used for cattle, while wetlands have been drained, forcing the deer into smaller and smaller areas. Large hydroelectric projects along the Tiete, Parana, and Rio Grande Rivers have flooded large areas of their grazing land, too. Now the remaining grassland is very fragmented and groups of deer have become isolated. Other threats include the hunting of these deer for meat, bush fires, water pollution, and disease that is passed by cattle to the deer.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The marsh deer is listed on CITES Appendix I. Although some deer live in protected areas, most have no protection. One of the last strongholds is the Pantanal Wetlands, a huge wetland area in Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia that is partly protected. It is hoped that new protected areas will be created to ensure the deer survive. There are education programs in local schools to teach children about the importance of conserving these deer. The star of one program is a marsh deer called Guri who was rescued when he fell into a concrete drain in 2009. Guri was fitted with a radio collar and released, and now school children are following his progress. Some deer are kept in captivity in Brazil and are part of a breeding program. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Marsh deer frequently wade in water, preferring areas where it is less than 2 feet (60 centimeters) deep. The deer's hooves spread out when they walk and this helps them to cross swampy land without sinking in the mud.</p>
