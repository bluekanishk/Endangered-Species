<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Clouded leopard</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Neofelis nebulosa</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4&#8211;6 feet (1.2&#8211;1.8 meters) almost half of which is the tail  </p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 21 inches (53 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The smallest of the big cats, clouded leopards are named after their skin markings. They have a dark cream coat with large brown and black cloud-like patches, which give them excellent camouflage in their rain forest habitat. They hunt deer, wild pigs, small monkeys, and birds, and hunt in trees and on land. Clouded leopards have an extra long tail that they use for balance, and also specially adapted ankle bones that allow their feet to turn backward so they can hang from trees by their feet and climb down trees headfirst. They can also climb along the underside of branches hanging upside down.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests of China and Southeast Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 85&#8211;93 days and give birth to 1&#8211;2 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main causes of the decline of the clouded leopard population are habitat loss across its range, and poaching. Deforestation in Southeast Asia has resulted in fragmented forests, and this has meant that the leopard cannot hunt in as wide a territory as it would like. Also, it does not have so many areas in which to shelter or raise its young. Many clouded leopards have been killed for their fur, which is sold illegally, as well as for their teeth and bones, which are used in Asian medicine.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Little is known about the behavior of these shy cats, so the first step in trying to save them is to learn more about how they behave in the wild. Several conservation organizations are studying them in their habitat and also assessing their numbers more accurately, in particular WildAid, working in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand. However, it is important to try to stop the deforestation that is destroying their homes, and to stop the illegal trade in their fur. There are some clouded leopards in captivity but they have proved to be difficult to breed.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The skull and teeth of the clouded leopard have led scientists to think that it has developed similar adaptations to the long-extinct saber-tooth tiger. Clouded leopards have the longest upper canine teeth for their skull size of any modern carnivore. They can open their jaws to 100 degrees; lions can only open their mouths to 65 degrees. </p>
