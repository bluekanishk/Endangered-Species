<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Giant clam</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Tridacna gigas</i></p>




<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4 feet (1.3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 66 pounds (300 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These huge shellfish are one of the biggest and heaviest of the molluscs. Two large shells that join at the base protect the soft body of the clam. The shells open and close like a hinge. Clams are fixed to the reef or seabed and cannot move from that spot. They are filter feeders which means they suck in water and sieve out the plankton. Also, they have algae living inside their body and the algae supply the clams with sugars in return for a safe place to live.  </p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical reefs in the shallow waters of the Pacific Ocean</p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Clams reproduce by pouring eggs and sperm into the water where the sperm fertilizes the eggs. The eggs swim about for a short while before settling on the seabed where they start to grow. </p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Over 100 years</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The numbers of giant clams have fallen because they are collected for their meat, which is a delicacy in some countries. They are also collected and sold to the aquarium trade. This overharvesting has meant that the giant clam has disappeared completely from some coral reefs. They are slow-growing, so their recovery will take many years.   </p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The giant clam is listed on CITES Appendix II, so trade in the meat is controlled and permits are needed to harvest the clams. Giant clams grow well in aquaculture systems (similar to fish farms). The clams are sold for food and to the aquarium trade, reducing the need to collect clams from the wild. Clams from aquaculture systems have been reintroduced into coral reefs too, for example clams from Australia were released on to reefs around Tonga in the South Pacific Ocean. </p>
