<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Sand cat</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Felis margarita</i></p>






<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 30 inches  (76.2 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This small wild cat has a triangular face and large ears. Its thick fur is a yellow-brown color with black markings. The black absorbs heat during the day, which helps to keep the cat warm during the cold desert nights. Sand cats have excellent hearing and can pick up noises from possible prey both above and beneath the sand&#8212;this cat is good at digging up prey from under the sand as soon as it hears any sound. The undersides of its paws are covered in thick fur, helping it to move easily across the desert terrain and protecting its paw pads from the heat of the sand. Sand cats rest in burrows during the day, and hunt at night when it is cooler for birds, rodents, lizards, snakes, and hares. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Unlike many other endangered animals, the desert habitat of the sand cat is not being lost and in many places it is getting larger. The main threat to the sand cat comes from humans who shoot the cats, either for sport or to protect livestock, such as chickens. Sometimes the cats are caught in traps put out for foxes. They are also caught and sold as pets. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The cat is protected in many countries across its range and it is listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting is less common and is illegal in some countries. The sand cat occurs in a number of protected areas, such as the Djebel Bou-Hedma Biosphere Reserve in Tunisia. More research is needed to gather information about its needs, range, and the numbers of cats that are still in the wild. </p>
