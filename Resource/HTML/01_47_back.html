<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Guanaco</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lama guanicoe</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 4 feet (1.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 265 pounds (120 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Guanacos have a round body, long slim legs, a longish neck, and long ears. Their wooly coat is brown on the back and legs, with a white underside and neck, and grayish head. They are related to llamas and camels. Guanacos live in groups of females and young that are protected by a male. Other males live alone or in small groups of just males. They eat mainly vegetation, such as grasses and shrubs. Males fight for leadership of the groups and they can be quite aggressive. They ram their chests together, neck wrestle by twisting their neck around the other's neck, and biting with their sharp, hooked teeth, while making high-pitched screams and deep growls.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 600,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Arid and semi-arid grasslands, deserts, and savanna of South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 14&#8211;24 months old. They are pregnant for 11&#8211;12 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 28 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the numbers of guanacos fell as they were hunted for their wool, skin, and meat. There was also an increase in sheep farming on their traditional grazing lands, and so there was more competition for food. Overgrazing by flocks of sheep is common, and this has lead to a loss of vegetation and soil erosion, preventing new growth. Also, many farmers kill guanacos because they believe, quite wrongly, that they spread disease to their sheep. Other threats come from oil and mineral mining, new roads being built across their grasslands, and climate change.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Guanacos are listed on CITES, so trade in their products is regulated. Most guanacos live in unprotected habitats so the education of local farmers is critical to their survival. For example, it is vital for farmers to know how to manage the grasslands and avoid overgrazing with their livestock. Guanaco fleece is worth 30 times more than the fleece of a sheep, so rather than kill the guanaco, organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society are investigating the humane shearing of wild guanacos, which are then released after shearing, so that the local people can make a living from the wool.</p>
