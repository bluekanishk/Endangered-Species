<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Red panda</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ailurus fulgens</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2 feet (65 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Tail length</b>: up to 1.6 feet (48 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 13 pounds (6 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Red pandas were thought to be members of the bear family, but they are not bears, they are actually related to the raccoon. They also like to eat bamboo, which is why they were called red pandas. They have a thick, deep red fur coat, with a black underside, and a long, bushy tail with black stripes. Their habitat can get very cold, so they have fur on the bottom of their feet to keep them warm. Apart from bamboo, red pandas will also eat berries, rats, birds' eggs, and small lizards. They spend more than half their time sleeping. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,400</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Temperate forests and mountains in the Himalayas, northern Myanmar, and western China, where there is a good supply of bamboo </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 18 months old. They are pregnant for 4 or 5 months and give birth to 2 cubs. They breed every 1&#8211;2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 8&#8211;12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to red pandas is the loss of their bamboo forest habitat. Without these forests red pandas will not find enough bamboo to eat. In countries such as Nepal, there is large-scale clearance of the bamboo forest for timber, fuel, and farming.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The key to the survival of the red panda is the protection of its bamboo forests. In Nepal, the Red Panda Network is working with local communities, teaching them that conservation of the forests will help their lives as well as the survival of the red panda. They have set up a network of forest guardians who find forests with red pandas that lie outside protected areas, such as national parks. There are plans to establish a new protected area in eastern Nepal, managed by local communities, that will link three existing protected forests and create an important wildlife reserve that will be a safe home for red pandas and other animals.</p>
