<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>African elephants have a large body with enormous ears, a long trunk, and pillar-like legs. Their thick, wrinkly skin is grayish-brown and their tail ends in a tassel of hair. Both males and females have tusks that grow up to 6 feet (2 meters) in length.</p>
<p>Elephants eat vegetation, such as leaves, twigs, and berries. They live in herds of mainly females and young led by the eldest female who is known as the matriarch. </p>

<p>Forests, savannas, and arid grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 70 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>African elephants are threatened by poaching, habitat loss, and climate change. Elephants are hunted and killed for their ivory tusks, which are very valuable. In 1930, there were as many as 5 million elephants in Africa, but by 1989 hunting had reduced this number to just 600,000. They were then classed as endangered and the trade in ivory banned. Sadly, poaching for both ivory and meat is still a major problem. The African elephant's habitats are being destroyed to make way for new farmland, roads, and towns. Thousands of elephants died in the severe drought that hit East Africa in 2008 and 2009.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In many African countries elephants are protected by law, but two-thirds of all elephants live outside of national parks and game reserves. Often they roam onto farmland where they damage crops and come into conflict with people. Elephant conservation organizations are working with local people to find solutions, such as moving problem elephants away from where people live. Anti-poaching patrols have been set up in areas where a lot of poaching takes place. Elephants attract tourists so local people are being taught to look after their elephants because tourists bring money into a community.</p>
