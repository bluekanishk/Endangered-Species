<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Puma</b> <br/>also called cougar or mountain lion</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Puma concolor</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Tail length</b>: up to 3 feet (96 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 265 pounds (120 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These big cats have a long body and long back legs that are ideal for bursts of fast running and jumping. They have a sandy-colored coat with a black tip on the end of their very long tails. They can live in a wide variety of habitats, and are good at climbing trees and swimming. Pumas live alone and have large territories. They rest during the day and hunt deer and small mammals in the evening and at night. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Deserts and rain forests throughout Canada and the U.S., Central and South America as far south as Chile</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3 years old. They are pregnant for about 3 months and give birth to 3&#8211;4 cubs. They breed about every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>In the past, pumas were hunted by farmers who wanted to protect their livestock, and they were also killed by rural communities who feared them. It was legal in many countries, such as Canada and the United States, to hunt the puma for sport. In many areas the pumas have lost their forest habitats, and, as the human population increases and spreads, so pumas are coming into close contact with people. Pumas have large territories and many are killed on roads as they move around in search of prey or mates.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The puma is now a protected species in much of Central and South America, but in North America and Peru hunting continues, although it is regulated. There is no protection for the puma in Ecuador, El Salvador, and Guyana. Wildlife corridors are being established to link fragments of forests to make it easier for these big cats to move around. Education programs are teaching people how to live safely alongside the pumas. </p>
