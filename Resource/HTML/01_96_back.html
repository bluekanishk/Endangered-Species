<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Walrus</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Odebenus rosmarus</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 12 feet (3.6 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 3,432 pounds (1,557 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>One of the largest pinnipeds, the walrus has a reddish-brown skin, short front flippers and long, back flippers with tiny claws. A walrus can walk on all four flippers. Both males and females have two large tusks that they use for defense, and also to help haul themselves in and out of the ice. Walruses have very sensitive whiskers that they use to find food, such as clams and mussels, buried in the sand. They live in large groups from tens to thousands. The largest walrus with the longest tusks is usually head of the group.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown, but declining</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Data deficient</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Arctic and sub-Arctic</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 7&#8211;8 years old. They are pregnant for 15 months, and give birth to a single calf. They breed about every 3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Walruses were commercially hunted for their tusks, fur, and meat for several hundred years, until the Second World War. Now the main threat to their survival comes from global warming and overfishing. Shifts in weather patterns mean that sea ice is melting, and this could reduce the areas where walruses come out of the water to give birth to pups, and hunt for food, such as fish. There are also increased threats from more shipping, which is now entering previously inaccessible areas, and from oil spills.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Walrus hunting was banned in Canada in 1931, and in the U.S. in 1941. Inuit peoples are allowed to take a small number of these animals each year. Hunting is also controlled in Norway. Thousands of Pacific walruses were killed to feed foxes kept on fur farms in Russia, but this has declined as the popularity of fox fur has fallen. </p>
