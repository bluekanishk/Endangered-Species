<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Indri</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Indri indri</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 38 inches (97 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 22 pounds (10 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Indris are the biggest of all the lemurs but they have the shortest tail, at only 2 inches (5 centimeters) long. They have thick, silky fur, which is mainly black and white, and large eyes. Indris are arboreal, and use their long, powerful back legs to jump upright in long leaps through the trees&#8212;they can leap over 30 feet (10 metres). They have big hands and feet to help them cling on to branches. When indris do occasionally drop to the ground, they leap sideways with their arms outstretched to give them balance. They eat fruit and flowers. Indris live in small family groups and are very noisy, making loud calls and screeching noises. Madagascans call the indri <i>babakoto,</i> which means "man of the forest" or "little father". </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 10,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Coastal rain forests in Eastern Madagascar</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 9 years old. They are pregnant for about 5 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 1&#8211;2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 40 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The indri is one of the most endangered of all the lemurs and has suffered from large-scale habitat loss. Their forests have been cleared for timber and fuel, and to make way for new settlements, farmland, and industry. These forests are now fragmented and the populations of indri have become isolated.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The best way to save the indris from extinction is to conserve their habitat. Some of the remaining forests have been given protection, but illegal logging is still continuing. Conservation groups are working with local farmers to teach them new techniques so that they do not need to clear more forest. Unlike many other lemurs, the indri does not breed well in captivity because they do not like being kept in a closed space. One small group of these lemurs needs up to 25 acres (10 hectares) of forest.</p>
