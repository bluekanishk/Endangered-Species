<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Chimpanzee</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Pan troglodytes</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 3 feet (94 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 154 pounds (70 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Chimpanzees belong to the ape family, and are one of the closest relations to humans, sharing 98 percent of the same genes. Chimpanzees have a long body and long arms and legs, and are covered in thick, short, black hair. Their face, palms, and the soles of feet are hairless, and the color of their skin ranges from pink to black. Chimpanzees are very sociable and live in large groups. They communicate with a range of noises, body language, and facial expressions. Chimps are highly intelligent and are known to make tools to help them catch food. For example, they will strip the leaves off a small branch and push it into an ant nest. The ants cling to the stick, which the chimpanzees lick clean when they pull it out. Chimps also eat leaves, flowers, and seeds. They hunt as a group to catch monkeys to eat, especially young colobus monkeys. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 100,000&#8211;200,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Woodland in Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Cameroon in West Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 10&#8211;11 years old. They are pregnant for 8 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 5 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 35&#8211;40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Chimpanzees are under threat from the extensive deforestation that is taking place across Central and West Africa. Tropical forests have been cleared for timber, farmland, and mining, leaving fragments in which groups of chimpanzees survive. A more recent threat is the surge in the bushmeat trade. The rapidly increasing human population has driven up the demand for this meat and chimpanzees, along with other primates, are killed for this trade. There is also a trade in young chimpanzees for pets. In some areas, chimpanzees have suffered from diseases, such as ebola, that also affect humans. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The chimpanzee is listed on CITES Appendix 1. There are a number of national parks where chimpanzees are protected, such as Gombe River in Tanzania. However, the best way to protect the chimpanzee is through community projects and education.  For example, local communities are being taught how to manage the forests and develop sustainable farming methods, and environmental education programs have been set up in schools. In addition, the Jane Goodall Institute has a rehabilitation center in Congo where orphaned chimpanzees are reintroduced to the wild. </p>
