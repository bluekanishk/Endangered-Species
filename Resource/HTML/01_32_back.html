<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Common brushtail possum</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name<i>:</i></b><i> Trichosurus vulpecula</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: body up to 23 inches (58.4 centimeters); tail up to 16 inches (40 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These possums have thick, wooly fur that is silver-gray or brown on top, and paler underneath. They have a long, bushy tail that they use to grip branches as they move through the treetops. Their large ears are pointed and they have big, slightly bulging eyes. Possums are marsupials, and the females have a forward-facing pouch on their tummy where their young stay. These possums are arboreal and nocturnal. They mainly live alone, but communicate using a wide range of noises including coughs, grunts, hisses, and screeches.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry forests and rain forests of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They are pregnant for 16&#8211;18 days and give birth to a single young. They breed every 3 or 4 years. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 13 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Possums were hunted for their valuable fur, but this has almost stopped. Many people consider them pests because of the damage they do to trees and the diseases they carry. Once common all over Australia, in recent years brushtail possum numbers have declined in the dry areas, and they are now classed as endangered in the Northern Territory. The causes for the decline include habitat loss due to deforestation, and fires that happen during droughts, as well as increased predation by dingoes and introduced animals, such as dogs and foxes. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The common brushtail possum has proved to be a very adaptable species, and it has moved into urban areas where it is often seen in parks and gardens. In areas where it is declining, conservation organizations are controlling the numbers of foxes and providing nest boxes for the female possums.</p>
