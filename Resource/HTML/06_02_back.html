<h2 class="inv">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Brain coral</b> <br/>also called closed brain coral</p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Leptoria phrygia</i></p>

<h2 class="inv">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 16 feet (5.3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters) </p>

<h2 class="inv">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Brain corals are made up of colonies of hundreds of individual life forms called polyps that join together. They are called brain corals because they look like the human brain. Each colony forms a large mound with curved dips and ridges, and is beige-brown to red in color. Brain corals are found in many coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, where they occur at depths of between 10 and 50 feet (3 and 15 meters). Corals get their nutrients from algae called zooxanthellae. Through photosynthesis, the algae passes nutrients to the coral and helps it to grow healthily.</p>

<h2 class="inv">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="inv">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Shallow reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans; from the east coast of Africa, to southern Japan and Australia </p>

<h2 class="inv">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Each colony produces eggs at a certain time of the year, usually linked to a phase of the moon, such as a new moon. The eggs develop into polyps that join the rest of the colony. </p>

<h2 class="inv">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="inv">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Global warming is a major threat to all coral. When sea temperatures increase, corals undergo bleaching. This is when they lose the zooxanthellae that live within their body, and turn white. Without the zooxanthellae they cannot get enough food and die. Another problem is acidification of the ocean. When levels of carbon dioxide gas increase in the atmosphere, more dissolves in water and the seawater becomes more acidic. This affects the coral building process, the corals become brittle and their growth slows down. Other threats include water pollution and sedimentation caused by rivers carrying more silt. The silt settles over the coral and kills it. Overfishing is also threatening the coral, because it means there are fewer fish feeding on algae and the algae smothers and suffocates the corals.  </p>

<h2 class="inv">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Brain corals are placed on CITES Appendix II, so all trade in coral, both living and dead, is controlled. There are a number of new Marine Protected Areas, the largest being the British Indian Ocean Territory around the Chagos Islands. Here, the coral reefs are protected and fishing is controlled. Marine protected areas can conserve whole reefs, but international efforts are needed to combat global warming. </p>
