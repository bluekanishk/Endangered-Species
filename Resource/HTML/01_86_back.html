<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Sloth bear</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Melursus ursinus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 feet (1.9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 35 inches (90 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 320 pounds (145 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The sloth bear has long, black shaggy fur, a cream "v" or "y" shape on its chest, and a bald, pale snout and mouth. Its favorite foods are termites and ants. It will break into a termite nest using its long, hooked front claws. The bears then stick their upper lip and tongue into the nest, and suck up the termites through a gap in their front teeth. Sloth bears also eat honey, fruit, vegetation, and eggs. These bears are solitary animals, apart from females with their young.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 7,000&#8211;10,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Grasslands and forests in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3 or 4 years old. They are pregnant for 6 or 7 months and give birth to 2 cubs. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threats to the sloth bear are habitat loss and poaching. There has been extensive clearance of their forests for timber, teak plantations, farmland, and settlements. In some areas, refugees have moved into forest areas, causing damage by taking too much firewood, and killing animals for bushmeat. Also, many parts of the sloth bear's body are used in traditional Asian medicines and many have been poached for this reason. Sloth bears can be aggressive and many have been killed by people who fear them. For a long time, young bears were captured and trained as dancing bears in India, but this is now banned. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The sloth bear is protected across its range, and is listed on CITES Appendix I. More than half the bears live in protected areas, such as national parks. However, those living outside these areas are at risk from poaching. Education is vital to teach people how to behave around the bears, and to reduce conflict with them. In some regions, there are forest replanting programs, which will help to provide the bears with more habitat. Many dancing bears have been rescued and are now living in rehabilitation centers. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The sloth bear gets its name from its ability to hang upside down from a branch. When the bear was first spotted by Europeans they thought it was a sloth. </p>
