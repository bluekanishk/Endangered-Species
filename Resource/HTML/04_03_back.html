<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Great crested newt</b> <br/>also called Northern crested newt and Warty newt</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Nectophrynoides asperginis</i></p>



<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>:  up to 6 inches (15.2 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b>  up to 3.5 ounces (10 grams)</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This large newt has a dark brown body with a warty skin. Its underside is bright orange with black marks; each newt has its own unique pattern of marks. During the breeding season, the males develop a jagged crest along their back and a silver-white streak across their tail. The newts breed in spring, laying their eggs in large ponds where there is plenty of pondweed and, ideally, no fish. They may use several ponds, migrating between them during the year. Great crested newts are active at night, when they emerge from their hiding places to hunt water invertebrates, such as pond beetles, dragonfly larvae, and tadpoles, while on land they hunt insects, slugs, snails, and worms. </p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least Concern</p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Woodlands, grassland, parks, and gardens with ponds, across Northern Europe, from the United Kingdom to the Balkans, and as far east as the Ural Mountains in Russia</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females lay hundreds of eggs in water in February and March. The eggs are wrapped in a leaf or pondweed.  </p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 13 years</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main cause of the decline of great crested newts in countries such as Belgium and the United Kingdom is the loss of their breeding ponds and surrounding habitats. Some ponds have been dug up, while others have been left unmanaged so they have become choked with pondweed. Newts need undisturbed areas near ponds, such as hedgerows and long grass, where they can hide during the day. The adults often migrate from one pond to another in the area during the year, and loss of habitats on their migration routes can disrupt this, for example, by building homes and roads. In addition, the newts are affected by water pollution from pesticides and fertilizers. In Russia, the newts are collected for the pet trade. </p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Great crested newts have been given protection in some countries, such as Belgium, Germany, and Poland. In the United Kingdom they have been given priority status and it is illegal to capture, kill, or injure them, or disturb their breeding ponds. In many European countries ponds are being restored and new ones built to provide more habitat for the newts. </p>

<p class="wow amp"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>During the breeding season the males put on a courtship dance to impress the females. A male stands on his front legs in front of a female and arches his back to show off his crest and waves his tail around.
