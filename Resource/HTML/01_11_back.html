<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Asiatic black bear</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ursus thibetanus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 feet (1.9 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 375 pounds (170 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Asiatic bears have black fur with a white or cream "V" shape on their chest, and longer hair around their neck and shoulders, like a mane. If they are threatened, the bears will stand up and display the white mark to startle predators. They are mainly omnivores, and climb trees to reach fruit and nuts, but they will sometimes eat insects and carrion. They live alone.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests in the hills and mountains of South Asia: Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, and northeast China. To the north they live in southeast Russia, Taiwan, and Japan</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4&#8211;5 years old. They are pregnant for 4&#8211;6 months, and give birth to 1&#8211;2 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Numbers of Asiatic black bears have fallen by almost half over the last 30 years. The main cause has been the loss of their forest habitat. The massive increase in the human population in Asia has resulted in large-scale clearance of forests for farmland, new settlements, and roads. Another threat is hunting for their fur and their body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. Many bears are kept in bear farms where a tube is fitted to extract bile from their gall bladder. Bile is used in many of the traditional medicines. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Asiatic black bear is protected both by international laws and national laws, for example the bear is a protected species in China and India. The best way to help safeguard the future for these animals is to reduce the demand for medicines that use bear body parts. This would also reduce poaching and bear farming. There are a number of captive breeding programs, such as in South Korea, where captive-bred bears have been released back into the wild.   </p>
