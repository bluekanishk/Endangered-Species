<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Giant anteater</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Myrmecophaga tridactyla</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 7 feet (2.2 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 99 pounds (45 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>With a large stocky body, short legs and a long slim snout, giant anteaters are very strange-looking mammals. They have long hair that is reddish-brown with black and white striped markings. They have long sharp talons that can rip into a termite nest, and a sticky tongue that is up to 24 inches (61 centimeters) long. The anteaters make a hole in a termite nest and insert their tongue, which comes out covered in termites. A single anteater can eat up to 30,000 insects in a day. They spend up to 15 hours a day sleeping, and when asleep they wrap their long bushy tail around themselves. This keeps them warm and helps to disguise them from predators while they sleep. Giant anteaters are almost blind, but use their sense of smell to find insect nests. They have no teeth and walk on their wrists, which helps to protect their talons from damage.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry forests and savannas in central and eastern South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females start to breed at about 4 years. They are pregnant for 6 or 7 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 1 or 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown; up to 26 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main cause of the decline of this species has been the loss of its habitat, in particular dry forests and grasslands, such as the cerrado, which once covered a quarter of Brazil. During the 1990s, much of this land was cleared and changed into cattle ranches, and soy and sugar cane plantations. Other threats come from man-made fires, which kill the slow-moving anteaters, and from road vehicles. In some regions anteaters are killed for meat and fur, while in others domestic dogs are a problem. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Giant anteaters are protected and are listed on CITES. However, it is a little studied species and until more is known, it is difficult to plan its conservation. Captive breeding programs have not been successful, so the best way to conserve giant anteaters is to protect their habitat. One exciting conservation project is Conservation International's Guyana Shield, a huge protected tropical wilderness on the borders of Brazil, Venezuela, and Guyana that covers about 13 percent of South America. Here animals such as the giant anteater are protected. </p>
