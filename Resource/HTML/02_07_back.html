<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Greater rhea</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Rhea americana</i></p>



<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.6 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 55 pounds (25 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These large birds look like ostriches. They cannot fly but have long, powerful legs that enable them to run really fast&#8212;they can reach speeds of up to 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour.) They have a long neck, small head, and a big, round body. Their body is covered in gray-brown feathers. Rheas are also good swimmers. They live mainly in large flocks, and eat insects, small mammals, grass, seeds, fruit, and lizards.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Woodland and pampas in central and southeastern South America </p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>A male will attract a group of females into an area. The male builds a nest and all the females lay eggs in the same nest. An average number of eggs is 20&#8211;30, from about 12 females, but there can be up to 80. The male incubates the eggs. The eggs hatch after 35&#8211;40 days and the male looks after the chicks.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 15 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are several threats facing rheas. There has been considerable loss of habitat due to the expansion of crop and livestock farming. There are huge ranches where merino sheep, cattle, horses, and goats are raised, and these animals compete with the rheas for grazing. Often the farms are fenced and this restricts the movements of these large birds. In some cases, birds have been injured on barbed wire fencing. Rheas are protected in Argentina, but hunting for their meat, skin, and feathers still continues, and their eggs are collected. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The trade in wild-caught rheas is restricted. There are some protected areas where rheas occur, including Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina. Research has found that livestock ranching and overgrazing are a lesser threat compared with hunting and egg collection, especially the latter. Rheas bred in captivity may be reintroduced into the wild in the future. </p>
