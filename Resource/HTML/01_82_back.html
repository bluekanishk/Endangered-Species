<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Ring-tailed lemur</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lemur catta</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3.6 feet (1.10 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 7.7 pounds (3.5 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This lemur has an exceptionally long and bushy black-and-white ringed tail. It has mainly dark reddish-brown fur with a white underside and face, and dark rings around its eyes. It has a long body and long limbs, and on the ground it walks on all fours. Ring-tailed lemurs use their limbs and tail to swing through the trees and hang from branches. They are very sociable animals and live in groups called troops that are lead by the females. During the day, they sit upright and sunbathe and groom each other. They eat fruit, leaves, flowers, and insects.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and scrubland in Madagascar</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are between 2&#8211;4 years old. They are pregnant for 4&#8211;5 months and usually give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 16&#8211;19 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to this lemur has been the loss of its forest habitat. More than 90 percent of the Madagascan forests have been cleared for timber, farmland, mining, and settlements. As the human population grows rapidly, people are coming into closer contact with the lemurs. Other threats include hunting for bushmeat, and the capture of young lemurs for pets. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>This lemur is listed on CITES Appendix I so it cannot be traded internationally. It is a protected species in Madagascar, and many of the remaining forests in which it is found have been given protection, too. Education is important so that local communities learn that by saving the lemurs they can earn a living from ecotourism. Ring-tailed lemurs have bred well in captivity and are found in many zoos around the world.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Male lemurs have stink fights. If a male is competing with another male for a female, he will rub his tail on his scent glands on his wrists and near his armpits, and then wave his smelly tail at the other male. The opponent will either run away or scent his own tail and wave it back. </p>
