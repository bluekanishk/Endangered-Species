<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>European bison</b> <br/>also called wisent  </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Bison bonasus</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 6.6 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 2,205 pounds (1,000 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These large, heavy animals have a short, thick, red-brown coat and a long mane of hair around their head and shoulders. They have short legs, a short neck, and a big head with curved horns. European bison live in herds. In winter, the males and females live together, but in spring they separate forming herds of females and their young, and herds of just males. Bison graze on grasses, roots, and leaves. They need to drink every day, and in the winter months will break ice with their hooves to reach the water underneath. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Deciduous forests and grasslands in Eastern Europe</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3 years old. They are pregnant for 8&#8211;9 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 1&#8211;2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Thousands of European bison once roamed the grasslands of Europe, but hunting and loss of habitat to make way for farmland and new settlements wiped out the herds. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, only two herds remained in the wild. After the First World War, many people in central Europe were starving and they killed the bison for meat. By 1927, bison were extinct in the wild in Europe and fewer than 60 survived in captivity.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the European bison bred well in captivity, and it was possible to reintroduce the species into the wild. There are now about 2,000 animals in the wild, living in protected areas such as the Bialowieza Forest in Poland. They are breeding so well that numbers are being controlled. An additional 1,400 bison live in captivity in more than 200 breeding centers across Europe, ensuring the survival of the species. However, the main problem is that all the bison are very inbred, having descended from a few bulls, and this can cause health problems for the survivors.</p>
