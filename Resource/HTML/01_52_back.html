<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Humpback whale</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 63 feet (19.2 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 30&#8211;50 tons (27&#8211;45.3 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Humpback whales have a torpedo shape with a big head that has deep grooves running from under the mouth to the middle of their body. They have huge flippers that can reach up to 16.5 feet (5 meters) in length, and two flukes. The skin color of the humpback ranges from blue-black to gray. Each whale has white patches on the underside of its flukes that are unique to each individual, like human fingerprints. The name humpback refers to the shape they make with their body when they leap out of the water (called breaching). Humpbacks live in groups called pods, and feed on krill, plankton, and small fish such as herring. The males sing beautiful songs during courtship. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 60,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern but some populations are endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Found in all the major oceans</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 7 years old. They are pregnant for 11&#8211;12 months, and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 1&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 45&#8211;50 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years, whales were hunted for their meat. During the 20th century, an estimated 200,000 humpbacks were killed in the Southern Ocean alone. They were almost wiped out, and the ban on commercial whaling in 1966 came just in time to save them. Whaling is still banned, but there are other threats, which mainly come from human sources. Overfishing is reducing the humpback's food supply, and there are harmful chemical pollutants in the oceans. Climate change is causing ice to melt at the poles and weather patterns to change, and this may affect the whales' migration routes and their food supply. Also, humpbacks are disturbed by underwater noise from boat propellers and submarines, which is increasing. The number of whales injured following collisions with ships and entanglements in fishing nets is also growing at an alarming rate.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The ban on hunting has resulted in an increase in the numbers of humpback whales. Their Red List status has been revised from vulnerable to least concern. Whale watching is very popular and many people earn a living from this tourist activity. However, as the number of ships and boats increases so do the number of injured whales. Now, many countries have laws stating that boats must not get too close, or travel too quickly, where whales are known to swim, so there is less chance of collision.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Humpbacks hunt in groups and create a "bubble net". Several whales circle underwater giving out a stream of bubbles, which trap tons of fish within a ring of air. The whales then feed together on the fish in their net.</p>
