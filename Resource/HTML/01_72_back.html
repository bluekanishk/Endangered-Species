<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Proboscis monkey</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Nasalis larvatus</i></p>






<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2.5 feet (72 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 24 pounds (11 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>So named because of their long noses, proboscis monkeys have reddish and cream colored hair with a tuft of dark red hair on top of their heads. Their long tails are the same length as their bodies. These monkeys are excellent swimmers, and can slip into the water and swim across rivers silently so as not to draw attention to themselves. They live in a group called a troop, and will sleep in trees preferably on branches that overhang water so they are safe from predators. Proboscis monkeys usually spend the day eating the leaves of mangrove and pedada trees, and then rest.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 7,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Mangrove forests nears swamps and rivers in Borneo, Southeast Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 4 years old. They are pregnant for 5&#8211;6 months and give birth to a single young.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The biggest threat to these odd-looking monkeys is habitat loss. There has been extensive clearance of rain forests and mangrove swamps across Borneo, mostly due to the demand for timber and for new oil palm plantations. The fragmentation of the forest is resulting in overcrowding in small patches of forest, and the monkeys becoming isolated from other groups by new settlements, farmland, and plantations. The monkeys are also hunted for their meat and fur. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The proboscis monkey is listed in CITES and is protected by law in Indonesia and Malaysia. There are a number of national parks and reserves that protect these monkeys, including the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Sabah, but only 15 percent of the monkeys live in these areas. There are plans to establish more wildlife corridors to link the forest fragments and to allow the proboscis monkeys to move from forest to forest more easily. Some isolated groups of monkeys have been captured and moved to more suitable forests. The largest group of proboscis monkeys outside of Borneo is found at Singapore Zoo, where there is a successful captive breeding program.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The male proboscis monkey has an amazing nose, which is not so large in the female. In older monkeys the nose can grow so long they have to move it aside to eat. Their noses swell and turn red when they become angry or excited. When there is danger they make a loud honking noise that makes their noses stand out straight!</p>
