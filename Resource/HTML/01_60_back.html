<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Malayan tapir</b> <br/>also called Asian tapir</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Tapirus indicus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 8 feet (2.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 4 feet (1.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 705 pounds (320 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISITICS</h2>
<p>Malayan tapirs have a round, stocky body, short legs with three toes, and long nails on each foot. They have a distinctive elongated nose and upper lip that forms a trunk. Their skin is black at the front and back of their body, with a wide, white band in the middle. Baby tapirs are shades of brown with a white, spotted pattern. This helps to camouflage them in the forests when their parents leave them to forage for food. Tapirs have small eyes and poor eyesight, but their hearing and sense of smell are excellent. Tapirs usually live alone and hunt for food mainly at night. They use their trunk to grab leaves, twigs, and fruit. They are also excellent swimmers and spend a lot of time in the water to stay safe from predators and to keep cool. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 3,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and scrubland in Myanmar, Thailand, Malaya, and Sumatra</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3 years old. They are pregnant for 13 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to the tapir is the loss of its rain forest habitat. The forests are being cleared at an ever-increasing rate for timber, and to make way for new oil palm and rubber plantations. The land is also being taken for growing crops, grazing livestock, and for new settlements. In more remote places, illegal logging is on the increase. As many larger animals, such as deer, become rarer, hunters are shooting other animals for meat that were not normally hunted, and this includes the tapir. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Malayan tapir is protected across its range and it is listed on CITES Appendix I. In Malaysia and Thailand most of the tapirs are found in protected forest, such as the Taman Negara National Park in Malaysia. There is an extensive network of national parks protecting the remaining rain forests in Thailand. However, it is different in Myanmar and Indonesia where there are large areas of unprotected rain forest. The Malay Tapir Conservation Project in Malaysia fitted five tapirs with radio-transmitters so they could be followed and studied. They also set up camera traps that took photos of tapirs, and from this they established more accurately how many tapirs lived in the area.  </p>
