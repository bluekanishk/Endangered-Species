<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Golden lion tamarin</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Leontopithecus rosalia</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 11 inches (28 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1.5 pounds (650 grams)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These little monkeys have an eye-catching red-gold coat of long hair covering their heads and bodies. They have long hands and feet that enable them to cling to trees, and a long tail for hanging from branches and for balance. They eat fruit, flowers, and small animals such as lizards, spiders, and frogs. They live in small groups.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 1,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests along the coast of Brazil</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 18 months old. They are pregnant for 4&#8211;5 months and give birth to 1&#8211;2 young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 8 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Golden lion tamarins were found almost exclusively in the Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil. Now 95 percent of this forest has been cleared. All that remains are isolated patches of trees. In the past, individual tamarins were caught and sold to wildlife collections. By 1980, just 100 individuals were left in the wild. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There has been a huge effort to save the beautiful golden lion tamarin, led by conservation organizations around the world. A huge educational program in Brazil has helped to make more people aware of the plight of the species. Captive breeding programs have been successful, and some animals have been reintroduced to protected areas of forest. By 2003, the reintroduction of a population into the Uni&#227;o Biological Reserve meant that there were enough wild tamarins for their Red List status to be lowered from critically endangered to endangered. Now, the wild population numbers more than 1,000, and there are about 500 in zoos. However, efforts have to continue to ensure that their forest habitat is conserved. </p>
