<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Addax</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Addax nasomaculatus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4.3 feet (130 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 3.8 feet (115 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 276 pounds (125 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The addax is an antelope that lives in the desert. Their short coat is gray-brown in winter and becomes near white during the summer. They have white face markings and a tuft of dark hair on the top of their head. Both male and female addax have long, twisted horns. They have a roundish body and long legs. Their hooves are splayed so that they can walk easily on sand. During the day they dig shallow holes in the sand under trees and rest to avoid the scorching sun and sandstorms. At night they forage for vegetation, such as herbs and grasses. They live in small groups. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown, but probably less than 500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Sandy, scrubby, and stony deserts in North Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1&#8211;2 years old. They are pregnant for 8&#8211;9 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 19 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This stunning deer was hunted for more than 150 years, for its horns, skin, and meat. Hunting increased when local tribes started using 4-wheel drive vehicles and automatic weapons. Most of the addax were then shot for sport, rather than for meat. Although this deer is adapted to living in arid conditions, there have been some severe droughts in the region and many have died.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The addax is listed on CITES Appendix I so international trade in its body parts is illegal. It is also protected in the countries where the remaining wild addax live, such as the Tin Toumma Desert of Niger where there are about 200 individuals. There are about 2,000 addax in captive breeding programs around the world, and there are plans to reintroduce the addax to parts of its former range. </p>
