<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Golden poison frog</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Phyllobates terribilis</i></p>



<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 2 inches (5 centimeters)   </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> less than 1 ounce (28 grams)</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This small, yellow frog is one of the group of poison arrow or poison dart frogs. The bright color warns predators that they are poisonous. The tribes of Colombia in South America rub their spear tips on the skin of the frogs to cover the tips in the poison secreted through the frogs' skin. The frogs do not make the poison themselves but get it from the food they eat. They live mainly on the ground close to small streams, and feed on insects such as ants and small invertebrates.</p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered </p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests along the Pacific coast of Colombia, South America</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay their eggs on the forest floor under leaves. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles are carried on the male's back to water where they develop into frogs after 10&#8211;14 weeks.</p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Golden poison frogs are at risk because they are found in one small area of unprotected rain forest. Habitat loss has been a main reason why they are endangered. The frogs have also been killed by the use of pesticides on crops. In addition, they are collected illegally for sale to the pet trade. Golden poison frogs, like most amphibians, are very sensitive to changes in their environment, and they are threatened by climate change, which may alter their habitat or food supply. A further threat to their survival has come from a deadly fungal disease that is spreading through the remaining population. </p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The protection of the rain forests in which the remaining frogs survive is essential. There are a number of captive breeding programs, including that of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust where there is a small breeding colony.</p>
