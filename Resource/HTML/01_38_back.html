<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>European wildcat</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Felis silvestris silvestris</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 45 inches (110 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 18 pounds (8 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The European wildcat is a subspecies of the wildcat that occurs across Europe, and from Central Asia to China. This wildcat looks like a domestic tabby cat, with its spotted fur and long tail. All wildcats have sharp, retractable claws for catching prey and climbing trees. Their diet consists mainly of small rodents, but they will also eat small birds, reptiles, and insects. Wildcats live alone and usually hunt at night. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown; Scottish wildcat around 400</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>The European wildcat is found in forests across Europe, from Scotland and Spain, to Romania and Greece </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 10&#8211;12 months old. They are pregnant for around 63 or 68 days, and can have as many as 8 kittens in a litter. They breed once a year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 6&#8211;15 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Once many millions of wildcats prowled throughout Europe. However, widespread clearance of their forests has led to their decline. Today, the greatest threat comes from the domestic cat, which breeds with the wildcat. There are very few pure wildcats left. Feral cats compete with wildcats for food and pass on disease. Some wildcats are killed on roads, while others are killed by gamekeepers and farmers, or die after eating poisoned rodents.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The European wildcat is protected across Europe. In Scotland, conservation groups are trapping and removing feral cats in an important wildcat area to prevent cross breeding. Deforestation has left small territories where wildcats live, so the establishment of wildlife corridors helps to connect isolated groups of wildcats so breeding opportunities are improved. </p>
