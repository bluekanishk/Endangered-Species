<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Galapagos giant tortoise</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Chelonoidis nigra</i></p>



<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: of shell up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 500 pounds (250 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>There are about 15 different subspecies of Galapagos giant tortoise, each found on a different island of the Galapagos Islands, Each subspecies has a different shell shape and color. These slow-moving land animals have a soft body that is protected by a hard shell made of bone. They can pull their legs and heads in under the shell for complete body protection when threatened. The shape of their shells can vary from high and round (domed), to quite flat. They eat grass, flowers, and fruit. Giant tortoises love to wallow in shallow, muddy puddles during the rainy season. The females lay their eggs in a shallow hole and then cover them with a muddy mix of soil and urine. Heat from the sun keeps the eggs warm during the day, and the soil prevents the heat escaping at night.   </p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 15,000</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rocky islands of the Galapagos, off the west coast of South America</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 40 years old. They lay between 2&#8211;16 eggs that are the size of tennis balls. They hatch after about 30 days.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 150 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Since the 1600s, sailors have come ashore on the Galapagos Islands for water and food. They caught the tortoises and stored them in the holds of their ships until they needed fresh meat. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the tortoises were killed for their oil. The main threat today is the increasing number of introduced species on the islands, such as cats and dogs, that hunt the young tortoises, while herds of goats, cattle, and pigs, overgraze the sparse vegetation and trample their nests. </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, scientists from the Charles Darwin Foundation have collected eggs from nests of wild tortoises and hatched them in captivity. The young tortoises are looked after until they are large enough to be released back into the wild again. Tortoises have been successfully reintroduced to islands where they were once found, for example the Hood Island giant tortoise. In 1971, the last 13 Hood Island giant tortoises were captured and taken to the Charles Darwin Research Station in Galapagos where they were bred. Since then they have been reintroduced to Hood Island where they are breeding again and their population has risen to more than 1,200.</p>
