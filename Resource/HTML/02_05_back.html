<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Gentoo penguin</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Pygoscelis papua</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 35 inches (95 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 13 pounds (6 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gentoo penguins are the fastest penguins underwater. They can dive 557 feet (170 meters) into the water, and can swim at speeds of 22 miles per hour (36 kilometers per hour). They stand upright on two short legs and webbed feet, and they have long flippers at either side of their body. All penguins have a black body with a white front, but gentoos also have a distinctive white stripe across their heads and a bright orange-red bill. They live in huge noisy colonies, and eat mainly fish, krill, and squid. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 300,000 breeding pairs</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>The rocky coastlines and grasslands on islands in Antarctica</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay 2 eggs, and incubation takes 34&#8211;36 days. Both parents look after the chicks. </p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 15&#8211;20 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Historically, gentoo penguins, especially those living near whaling bases, were hunted for meat and oil, and their eggs were collected as food. Over the last 30 years the numbers of penguins on the sub-Antarctic islands, such as South Georgia, have declined by two-thirds, which may be due to overfishing and water pollution. There is increasing disturbance to gentoo penguins on the Falkland Islands from tourism, oil drilling, and the building of roads and new developments. Climate change is likely to be a major threat to their habitat in the years to come.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Scientists are uncertain why some populations of gentoo are in decline, while others are increasing, so there are some long-term monitoring projects in operation to gather more information about the behavior of this penguin. Most of the larger gentoo penguin colonies are found in protected areas, such as MacQuarie Island and Heard Island, both Natural World Heritage Sites in the Southern Ocean. </p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Gentoo penguins gather pebbles to make a nest. They are very fussy over the size of the pebbles and will often steal the perfect pebble from their neighbors' nests leading to lots of squabbles.</p>
