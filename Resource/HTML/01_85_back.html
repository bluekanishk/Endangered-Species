<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Siberian tiger</b> <br/>also called Amur tiger</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera tigris altaica</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 13 feet (4 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 700 pounds (317 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Like other species of tiger, Siberians have orange fur with black stripes. However, the stripe pattern is unique to each tiger, like human fingerprints. They have strong, muscular legs, and a long tail, which they use for balance. A tiger needs to eat a large animal, such as a deer, every 3&#8211;5 days and may roam up to 12 miles (20 kilometers) in search of prey. Tigers stalk their prey then leap out and chase it down, so they need a habitat where they can stay hidden while hunting. They hunt red deer, sika deer, and wild boar.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 350&#8211;450</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Snowy mountains and birch woodlands in eastern Russia and northeastern China, near the Amur River</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3 years old. They are pregnant for just over 3 months and give birth to 1&#8211;5 cubs. But 50 percent of cubs die before reaching 1 year, many because their parents are poached. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Once Siberian tigers roamed freely across far eastern Asia. But they were hunted for their valuable fur, and by the 1930s fewer than 30 individuals remained in the wild. In 1947, hunting was banned, and since that time the population has slowly recovered to the current levels. Today, the main threats to their future are poaching, deforestation, forest fires, and over-hunting of their prey, especially deer. Poachers kill more than 20 tigers each year for their fur and their body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. Some tigers are shot when they attack people or their livestock.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>About 95 percent of the remaining tigers live in the far east of Russia, mainly in the huge Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve. The Siberian Tiger Project started in 1992 and biologists have fitted more than 60 tigers with radio-tracking devices so they can better understand the needs of the tiger. The Wildlife Conservation Society in Russia is working to reduce human-tiger conflict, and is working to move problem tigers away from areas where they come into contact with people. However, it is proving difficult to stop poaching because of the poverty of the people living in the region. A dead tiger is worth a lot of money. </p>
