<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Kiwi</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Apteryx Australis</i> (Southern brown kiwi),<i> Apteryx haastii</i> (Great spotted kiwi), <i>Apteryx mantelli</i> (North Island brown kiwi), <i>Apteryx owenii</i> (Little spotted kiwi)</p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 1.3 feet (40 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6.2 pounds (2.8 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These strange-looking flightless birds have spiky, brown feathers, a stocky, roundish body, long, pointed bill, and short legs. During the day, kiwis rest in burrows that they dig in the forest floor with their sharp claws. At night they use their long beaks to forage under leaves for insects. They mate for life. The kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 35,000 (North Island brown kiwi), 25,000 (Southern brown kiwi), 20,000 (Spotted kiwi), 1,000 (Little spotted kiwi)</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered (North Island kiwi), Vulnerable (Southern brown kiwi and Great Spotted kiwi), Near threatened (Little Spotted kiwi)</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and scrubland in New Zealand and nearby islands</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3&#8211;5 years old. They may lay 2 eggs in one clutch, but they are laid 2&#8211;3 weeks apart. The male incubates the eggs, which hatch after 2&#8211;3 months. They breed 2&#8211;3 times a year. </p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 20 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There were an estimated 12 million kiwis when the Maoris first arrived in New Zealand about 1,000 years ago and the birds were hunted for their meat and feathers. The arrival of Europeans in the 19<sup>th</sup> century lead to more hunting, and by 1930 just 5 million birds were left. Habitat loss and being killed by introduced animals, such as cats, dogs, stoats, weasels, and ferrets, has reduced the kiwi to its current population, and numbers are falling by half every year. Only 1 chick in 20 survives to become an adult.  </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In 1991, the New Zealand Government set up the Kiwi Recovery Programme. The aims of this program include research, education, and the establishment of protected areas free of predators. Farmers are asked to kill stoats and weasels on their land, and to fence small areas of bush as safe areas for kiwis. Eggs are collected and hatched in sanctuaries. The kiwi chicks are released into the wild when they are large enough to be safe from predators. So far five protected areas have been established, the largest of which is 44,470 acres (18,000 hectares) in size. There are a number of predator-free islands, such as Stewart Island, where there are 20,000 Southern brown kiwis, and Kapiti, Red Mercury, and Hen Islands that are home to little spotted kiwis. The numbers of little spotted kiwis have increased in recent years so the status of the species has been reduced to near threatened.</p>

<p class="wow bir"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Kiwis are the only known birds to have nostrils at the end of their beak. At night they can often be heard making snuffling noises, trying to clear dirt out of their nostrils while searching for food.</p>
