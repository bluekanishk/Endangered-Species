<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Snowshoe hare</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lepus americanus</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 20 inches (52 centimetres) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTCS</h2>
<p>These hares get their name from their large, extra-furry back feet that help them move about in deep snow during severe winters. Their fur is brown for most of the year, but it turns white in winter as camouflage against the snow. Snowshoe hares are shy animals that feed at night. They eat plants and berries in the summer, and bark and buds in the winter. Unlike rabbits, they do not dig burrows, but live above ground. Occasionally they are seen to burrow into snow.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests of Canada and North America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 months old. They are pregnant for 36 days and give birth to a litter of 4&#8211;13 young, called leverets.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 1 year</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The snowshoe hare is in decline right across its range. The causes are habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. With spring arriving earlier in the year, the snow is melting earlier and this makes it easier for predators to spot the white fur of the hare as its white coat has not changed color. Also, more hares are being hunted and killed by coyotes, which are increasing in number. The decline in these hares threatens its predator, the lynx. The lynx is very dependent on the hare as food. When hare numbers increase, so do those of the lynx, and when the hare decreases, the lynx decreases, too. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are hunting restrictions in parts of the United States in order to allow the snowshoe hare numbers to recover. There have been some captive breeding programs with captive-bred hares being released into areas where the wild hares are in decline. However, the introduced hares are more likely to be killed by predators than wild individuals. Research has discovered that hares do well in young forests, so having a mix of young and mature forests may boost their numbers. </p>
