<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Komodo dragon</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Varanus komodoensis</i></p>




<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10 feet (3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 200 pounds (91 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These may be the world's heaviest lizards, but Komodo dragons can still climb trees, run fast, and swim well. They have a long body and tail, short legs with sharp claws, and a scaly skin that is dark brown to black in color. They eat large mammals, such as deer, goats, and pigs, and even other Komodo dragons. When Komodo dragons bite their prey they inject it with venom. The prey soon becomes sick and weak, and quickly falls to the ground. Komodo dragons track their wounded prey so they can feast on it once it has become ill. They live alone except when breeding.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>3,000&#8211;5,000</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Hot, dry forests and savannas of the Indonesian island of Komodo, and a few neighboring islands </p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females dig a hole in the ground and lay between 20 and 40 eggs that hatch after about 7 months.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>20&#8211;40 years </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Over the last 50 years there has been a dramatic fall in the number of Komodo dragons. The main cause is habitat loss, but illegal hunting has caused a decrease in the animals they eat, especially deer. For example, Komodo dragons have disappeared from nearby Padar Island, and scientists believe this is due to deer poaching. Often the poachers set fires to force the deer from the forest, and the fires destroy the dragon's habitat and often kill the dragons.  </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Komodo dragon has been protected in Indonesia since the 1930s, and it is also listed on CITES so hunting is banned. Most of the surviving dragons are found in Komodo National Park (Indonesia) that covers Komodo Island and the surrounding islands, but there are some dragons that live in unprotected areas. Ecotourism is increasing and more than 18,000 tourists visit Komodo each year to watch the dragons, and this is bringing income to the region. There are several hundred dragons in captive breeding programs.</p>
