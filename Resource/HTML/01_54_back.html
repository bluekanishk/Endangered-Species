<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Jaguar</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera onca</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (1.9 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 355 pounds (160 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>One of the largest of the wild cats, jaguars have a patterned coat of brown and black ringed rosettes on a yellow-brown background. They are often confused with leopards, but jaguars have a stockier build, and a bigger head and jaw than leopards. They live alone deep in forests near water, and feed on prey such deer, peccaries (a type of small pig), and fish.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Maximum 20,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical rain forests and grasslands of Mexico and central South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2&#8211;3 years old. They are pregnant for 3&#8211;4 months and give birth to 2 cubs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 11 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>In the past, jaguars were hunted for their fur. During the 1960s and 1970s, as many as 18,000 jaguars were killed each year. Today there are other threats facing these wild cats. They have suffered a serious loss of habitat and this has brought them into closer contact with farmers and their livestock. Jaguars are trapped, shot, or poisoned by farmers wanting to protect their animals. Also, in some areas, there is a decline in the numbers of prey animals, so jaguars cannot find enough food.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society are working with farmers to find ways in which cattle and jaguars can coexist, and so reduce the number of jaguars that are killed. In some areas the jaguars' habitat has become fragmented, so conservationists are establishing corridors to connect the fragments of forest to allow the jaguar's habitat and other animals to move between them in safety. In Belize, in Central America, a large area of rain forest that is home to 200 jaguars is now protected. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The patterns on the jaguar's coat are caused by a pigment in the skin called melanin&#8212;the same pigment that makes human skin tan in the sun. Some jaguars produce too much melanin and in the dark, shadowy forest their coats appear completely black. These jaguars are usually called black panthers. However, if a black panther is seen in bright sunlight, its coat markings can be clearly seen.</p>
