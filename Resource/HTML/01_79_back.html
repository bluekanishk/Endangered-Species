<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Red squirrel</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Sciurus vulgaris</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 9 inches (22 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Tail</b>: up to 7 inches (18 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 12 ounces (350 grams)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Red squirrels get their name from their brownish-red coat and tail; their front is white. Their bushy tails are held curled up over their backs, and they have tufts of hair on the tops of their ears. These squirrels spend most of their time in the trees, scampering up and down the trunks and branches, and leaping from tree to tree using their tail for balance. They live alone. They feed on nuts, berries, leaves, fruit, and bird eggs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 150,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests, mainly conifer, large parks and gardens in Europe, northern Asia, and Siberia </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for 33&#8211;38 days, and give birth to 3&#8211;4 kittens. They breed twice a year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 6 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The red squirrel was hunted for its fur, and in some parts of Europe it still is. Numbers have fallen considerably in the United Kingdom, where more than 80 percent of the population is found in Scotland. The dramatic fall in numbers has been due in part to the loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat, but also to the introduction of gray squirrels from North America in the 1870s. The gray squirrel is more competitive than the native red squirrel, and it frequently raids the red squirrel's seed stores. Gray squirrels can digest unripe acorns, which the red squirrel cannot, so the grays have more food sources. Also, the gray squirrel is a carrier of the squirrel pox disease, which kills red squirrels.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The red squirrel is protected in most countries across its range. One way to save the red squirrel is to remove the gray squirrels. This has been done successfully on the island of Anglesey, off the north Welsh coast. In 2011, a new project called Red Squirrel Northern England was launched by a group of conservation organizations. This project aims to control gray squirrels within red squirrel areas and remove them if possible. A number of large conifer plantations have been identified as red squirrel territories and gray squirrels will be kept out. </p>
