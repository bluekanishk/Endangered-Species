<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>American bison</b> <br/>also called buffalo</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Bison bison</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 12 feet (3.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 7 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1 ton (0.9 tonnes) </p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>American bison have a large head with small, curved horns on either side, a big heavy body, and short legs. Their body is covered in a coat of thick, short, brown hair with a mane of thick, shaggy hair around their head, neck, and shoulders. Bison move continuously, grazing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. They live in groups of mainly females, young, and a few older males. Younger adult males live alone or in their own groups. In the winter, their thick coats protect the bison from freezing temperatures, and they use their head to dig through the snow to the vegetation beneath.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 20,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Plains of Canada and northwest U.S.</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 or 3 years old. They are pregnant for about 9 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 18&#8211;22 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Around 200 years ago, as many as 60 million bison roamed across North America, from Mexico to Canada. During the 19th century, settlers and hunters slaughtered them, and the species teetered on the edge of extinction. By 1906 a total of just 1,000 remained, some wild and some in captivity. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The survival of the bison is due to the Bronx Zoo in New York. In 1907, they sent a small group of animals by train to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Preserve in Oklahoma to increase the size of a herd of wild bison. Since then, breeding has been successful, and the total population is now more than 450,000. However, only 20,000 are wild, the rest are farmed. Today, there are wild herds in a number of National Parks, such as Yellowstone National Park and Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada. The survival of this species is important to the management of the prairies and other habitats because bison graze the grasses and prevent trees and shrubs from growing. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Bison have an enormous shoulder hump, which is a store of energy-rich fat. They use this fat during winter when there is thick snow on the ground and very little food. </p>
