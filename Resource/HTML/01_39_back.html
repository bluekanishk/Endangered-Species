<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Gaur</b> <br/>also called seladang, or Indian bison</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Bos frontalis</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 11.5 feet (3.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1 ton (1.1 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gaurs are the biggest of the wild cattle, and have a large, heavy body with shortish legs. Both the males and females have long, curved horns with black tips. The females and young have a short brown coat, while the males' coat is black. They live in herds of all females and young, led by a single male. They stay in the forest at night, but come out into open grassland to graze during the day. Gaurs are often seen grazing with red jungle fowl, which catch the insects kicked up by the feet of the gaur. In return, these birds are useful to the gaur as they give an early warning of nearby danger.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 1,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forested areas with open grasslands or glades throughout India and Nepal, to Vietnam and Malaysia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3 years old. They are pregnant for about 9 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The gaur has suffered from loss of its habitat across its range, especially in Southeast Asia where there has been extensive deforestation, but their numbers are stable in India. Being a large animal, the gaur has been hunted for its meat and also for its horns. Poaching continues especially in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam where international gangs operate, killing all gaur in one area before moving on to another. Gaurs are also seen grazing amongst cattle, competing for food and water. The cattle spread diseases, such as rinderpest and foot-and-mouth, to the gaur. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and it is protected in all the countries in which it occurs. It is important that its remaining habitats are protected, especially in Southeast Asia where the numbers of gaur are low. There are herds of gaur in many national parks in India where the disease rinderpest has been wiped out. There are plans to replace cattle with hybrid animals of gaur mated with cattle. These hybrids would be more suited to the forests and reduce the pressure on the remaining wild gaur. The forest habitat would be protected, as there would be no need to clear forest for new pasture. </p>
