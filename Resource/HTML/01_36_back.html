<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Echidna</b> <br/>also called spiny anteater</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Tachyglossus aculeatus</i> (short-beaked), <i>Zaglossus bruijnii</i> (Western long-beaked), <i>Zaglossus bartoni</i> (Eastern long-beaked), <i>Zaglossus attenboroughi</i> (Sir David's long-beaked) </p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: 14 to 30 inches (35 to 77 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 22 pounds (10 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Echidnas are monotremes, or egg-laying mammals, with a long, light-brown coat covered in short, sharp spines made of hair. The spines are more noticeable on the long-beaked echidnas. Echidnas have long, sharp claws for digging up earthworms, which are their main source of food. Their nose is at the end of their long snout. Short-beaked echnidas have a shorter beak than the long-beaked echidnas.  Echidnas are nocturnal animals that live alone. The female echidna has a deep pocket, called a pouch, on her belly. The baby, called a puggle, is carried around in the pouch for about 6 weeks, where it feeds on its mother's milk. When the puggle's spines form, the female removes it from the pouch and places it in a burrow. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically Endangered (long-beaked); Least Concern (short-beaked) </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Short-beaked echidnas are found in rain forests in Australia and on the island of New Guinea in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Long-beaked echidnas live in the mountain meadows and rain forests of New Guinea</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The female lays a single egg which she places in her pouch. It hatches after 10 days.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 50 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Echidnas in New Guinea have long been hunted for food by local people using dogs, and this continues today. In addition, echidnas are losing their habitat through deforestation to make way for more farmland and mining operations. The short-beaked echidnas living in Australia have also lost their habitat due to deforestation, and many die on the roads.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Echidnas are protected in New Guinea, but hunting has not stopped. Conservationists believe that education is important so that local people learn the importance of protecting the remaining animals. Captive breeding may be important to the survival of the long-beaked echidnas. Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia, has a breeding program, but other centers are needed to boost the echidna population. The short-beaked echidnas in Australia are under less threat and many live in protected areas. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The echidna has no teeth. Instead it has a groove down the middle of its tongue that is covered in spines. It sticks out its tongue and uses the spines to hook worms. The echidna's tongue is also sticky so it can catch ants and termites.</p>
