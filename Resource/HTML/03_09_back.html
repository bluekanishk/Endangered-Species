<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>King cobra</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ophiophagus hannah</i></p>




<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) </p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The king cobra is the longest of all the venomous snakes. It has a scaly, dry skin that is brown, olive-green, or black in color, with a lighter, striped underside. The king cobra has a broad, flat head, and a hood under its neck that it can spread out to make itself look bigger when it feels threatened. As well as hissing, the king cobra makes a growling noise when it is angry or threatened. King cobras travel along the ground and through water in search of prey, which is mainly other snakes, although they will also eat monitor lizards and the eggs of other reptiles and birds. King cobras kill by biting and injecting their prey with venom, which paralyses it.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forest and mangrove swamps throughout Asia</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females lay between 20&#8211;50 eggs and cover them with leaves. Heat from the rotting leaves incubates the eggs and they hatch after 60&#8211;90 days. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 20 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>As the human population in Asia has increased, more people have come into closer contact with the king cobra. Thousands of these snakes are killed by people who are afraid of them, and who want to protect their family and animals. Also, the king cobra has suffered from loss of its rain forest habitat, which has been cleared to make space for more farmland and new settlements. Some king cobras are caught and their body parts used in traditional medicines, and their skin made into leather.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II, so international trade in its skin and body parts is controlled, and permits are needed to hunt the snake. Research is being carried out into the behavior of the king cobra by the Whitley Fund For Nature, which has a rain forest reserve in Southern India. Educating people who live close to king cobras is important, especially for children who need to be taught how to behave around dangerous snakes. </p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>King cobra venom is not as strong as that of some snakes, but it injects a large amount in a single bite, which is sufficient to kill an adult human, and sometimes a fully grown elephant.</p>
