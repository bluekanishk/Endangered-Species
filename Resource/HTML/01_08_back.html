<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>American black bear</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ursus americanus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 7 feet (2.1 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 2.3 feet (6.9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 530 pounds (240 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The black bear's fur may be black or brown in color. They have hook-like claws that help them to climb trees. These bears will eat almost anything, including berries, seeds, nuts, fruit, fish, small insects, and carrion. In areas where they live close to people, black bears will raid garbage cans. The bears that live in colder regions hibernate for up to 7 months in the winter. In areas where it is warmer and there is food available, they do not hibernate at all.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 600,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests of Canada, North America, and northern Mexico</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3&#8211;8 years old. They give birth to 2&#8211;3 cubs, and breed every 2&#8211;3 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Bears scare people, and for this reason many have been killed even when they were no threat. Bears are also killed because they attack livestock, and also simply for sport. Habitat loss is another threat to their survival, with forests being cleared for new housing and roads. Groups of bears are becoming isolated as the forests shrink in size. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Strict controls on the hunting of bears are in place in both Canada and the U.S. and, as a result, the number of black bears is increasing. These bears have proved to be a very adaptable species and in many areas they live close to towns and cities. However, they are attracted by food and can become a nuisance, and even dangerous in urban areas. Teaching people how to behave around bears, and to keep food out of their reach, is important. This way people and bears can live side-by-side in safety. </p>
