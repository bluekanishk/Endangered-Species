<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>African wild dog</b> <br/>also known as the Cape wild dog, painted dog, and African hunting dog</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Lycaon pictus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 35.5 inches (90 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 70 pounds (32 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The name painted dog comes from the animal's splotchy coat. The top is a mix of browns and blacks, while underneath and on their legs they have white-gray and black markings. Each dog has a unique coat pattern. Their long tail has a white tip, which some zoologists believe is used as a "flag" to keep the pack together when they are hunting. They have four toes on each paw instead of five found on the front paws of wolves. (Domestic dogs have 4 toes, plus a dewclaw on their front paws.) These wild dogs live in packs of between 5 and 20 members that protect and nurse the old and injured. After a kill, the healthy dogs regurgitate food for the young, sick, and wounded pack members. Their prey includes deer, impalas, gazelles, and gnus. African wild dogs are very sociable, and make a wide range of noises including squealing, growling, whistling, calling, and twittering.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>3,000&#8211;5,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and grasslands of East and South Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They are pregnant for 69&#8211;73 days, and give birth to between 7 and 9 pups.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>African wild dogs have been hunted and killed by people for many years, and now their numbers are so reduced that their survival is threatened. The dogs have also lost their habitat, due to the expansion of farmland and new settlements. Now farmers trap and poison the wild dogs in order to protect their livestock. Domestic and feral dogs pose a threat as well because they carry fatal diseases, such as distemper, that are passed to the wild dogs.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Many of the remaining African wild dogs are found in protected areas, such as the Serengeti and Maasai Mara National Parks of East Africa. However, when food is scarce the packs of dogs move beyond the park boundaries and come into conflict with local people. Several conservation organizations are working with local communities. They are training volunteers to study the wild dogs so can they learn more about their behavior and requirements. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Unlike most other wild animal groups, the male African wild dogs stay with their pack after mating. This means a pack is made up of females and males, as well as the young. The male members of the pack are often left to care for the young if the females die or lose interest. </p>
