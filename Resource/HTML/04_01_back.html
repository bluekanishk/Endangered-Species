<h2 class="amp">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Axolotl</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i></p>



<h2 class="amp">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 12 inches (30 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 8 ounces (227 grams)</p>

<h2 class="amp">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These strange-looking amphibians are a type of salamander, but axolotls never grow up! They remain stuck at an early stage in their development instead of growing to look like adult salamanders. They remain at the stage where the larva begins to develop gills and legs. They have a flat body and head, with feathery gill growths on either side of their head. Axolotls can be white through to gray and dark brown in color. They have tiny teeth and feed on insects. Although they have lungs, axolotls can breathe through their skin, and they can also regrow limbs that have been injured. They live in water.</p>

<h2 class="amp">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Under 1,000</p>

<h2 class="amp">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="amp">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Canals and wetlands of Mexico</p>

<h2 class="amp">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females are ready to lay eggs around 12&#8211;18 months. They take in sperm released by the males to fertilize their eggs internally. The females then lay the eggs and attach them to a plant to stop them from floating away. The eggs hatch after 2&#8211;3 weeks. A single female can lay up to 400 eggs in one day.</p>

<h2 class="amp">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;12 years</p>

<h2 class="amp">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Although there are many axolotls in captivity, the wild population is small and centered around Mexico City, a city that has grown and developed rapidly. Wetlands have been drained and wells have been dug leading to the drying out of the valley in which most of the wild axolotls live. In addition, there is increased water pollution from sewage. Also, local people catch and eat young axolotls. There are threats, too, from introduced fish, such as tilapia and carp, that prey on the axolotls. </p>

<h2 class="amp">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Mexican government has protected the axolotl, and they are listed on CITES which restricts international trade. However, most of the conservation efforts are focused on the conservation area of Lake Xochimilco and the surrounding wetlands. Projects include the restoration of canals and wetlands, the control of predatory fish, and pollution control. Projects are underway to encourage ecotourism, which will bring jobs and income into the region. Conservationists are keen to establish more breeding colonies in case the remaining wild axolotls are lost to disease or natural disaster.  </p>
