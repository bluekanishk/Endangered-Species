<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Japanese macaque</b> <br/>also called snow monkey</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Macaca fuscata</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 66 pounds (30 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Japanese macaques have gray to brown fur, a short tail, and a red face. They live in groups called troops. These monkeys spend a lot of time grooming each other and looking after their young. In winter, they keep warm by sitting in the hot springs found in the mountain regions of Japan. They walk on all fours, or upright if they are holding something. They store food in their cheek pouches when hunting. They eat leaves, berries, small animals, and insects.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,000&#8211;3,850 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Sub-tropical forests and mountain regions of Japan and surrounding islands</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3&#8211;4 years. They are pregnant for 5&#8211;6 months and have 1 young. They breed once a year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 6&#8211;8 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Japanese macaques have suffered from habitat loss caused by the wide-scale logging of forests for timber and fuel, and from hunting. However, the main threats now come from people and the loss of natural forests to agriculture. As the forests decline, the macaques have been damaging crops in their search for food, and more than 10,000 macaques are killed each year to protect crops. Some macaques have lost their fear of people and wander into urban areas where many people consider them to be pests.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The main habitat for the macaques on Yakushima Island has been made a Natural World Heritage Site. This has helped to protect the monkeys' habitat and has led to an increase in their population. Ecotourism has increased, too. The macaques are expanding into new areas, such as towns and cities, which provide more habitats but also bring them into closer contact with people.  </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>A troop of macaques that live by the ocean has learned to clean sand off their sweet potatoes by washing them in the sea. Then they realized that the potato tasted better with salt, so they often dip the potato in the sea between each bite to season it.</p>
