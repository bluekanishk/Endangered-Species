<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>American badgers have a large, flat body, a small pointed head, small ears, short legs, and a short tail. Their fur is long, and gray-brown in color with black and white stripy markings on their head. They live in lots of different dens and burrows, and use them for sleeping, storing food, and giving birth. These badgers have long, sharp claws on their front feet, which enable them to burrow underground very quickly if they are threatened. They eat small mammals, birds, and lizards.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Open spaces in Canada, the United States, and Mexico</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 4 months old. They are pregnant for 6 weeks and give birth to 2&#8211;5 young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 8&#8211;14 years </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The American badger has few natural predators other than humans. It was hunted for its fur and this still continues in many parts of North America, where hunting is permitted during the winter months. Badgers are also trapped or poisoned by farmers because they dig holes in farmland. Some are also killed on roads. Other threats come from loss of habitat due to increased agriculture and settlements. In many areas the American badger is suffering from a lack of prey, especially prairie dogs and ground squirrels.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Hunting the badger was banned in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967, but the numbers of badgers did not increase. Now it is classed as an animal at risk and research projects have been carried out to learn more about its behavior, such as fitting badgers with radio transmitters to map their movements. Elsewhere, the badgers occur in protected areas such as National Parks and nature reserves.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>When out hunting, American badgers often dig into burrows made by other species, such as ground squirrels, rats, and gophers, to catch them on their return. Coyotes are sometimes seen standing by a burrow, while a badger is digging. They wait to catch any animal that tries to escape from the badger. </p>
