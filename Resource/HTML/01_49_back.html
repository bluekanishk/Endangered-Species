<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hawaiian monk seal</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Monachus schauinslandi</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 528 pounds (240 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Monk seals get their name from the fold of skin around their neck that looks like the collar of a monk's robe. Hawaiian monk seals have a round body, big front flippers, and a smooth, silver gray coat with pale undersides. The seals become darker with age. They feed on fish, squid, and octopus in shallow water close to land. They dive on average to a depth of 480 feet (147 meters), but some seals have been recorded diving to 1,787 feet (550 meters). Female seals haul themselves onto land to give birth to their pup. They have been seen on beaches of sand, coral, and volcanic rock, but their preferred birthing place is a sandy beach in a shallow, sheltered bay. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approximately 1,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered  </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>In the waters around the chain of Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 5 or 6 years old. They are pregnant for 11&#8211;12 months and give birth to a single pup. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 20&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Hawaiian monk seals are one of the most endangered seal species in the world. They have been hunted for their skin, meat, and oil for hundreds of years. Recent threats come from overfishing, which is reducing their food supply and also from fishing nets in which they become entangled. Also, they have suffered from an increase in pollution in the Pacific Ocean, due to the oil, sewage, plastic trash, and other pollutants that find their way into the ocean. Some of the beaches used by the female seals on the main Hawaiian Islands are also popular with tourists, so the seals are disturbed. A natural threat comes from sharks that prey on the pups and young seals. Sadly, the survival rate for seal pups is currently less than 15 percent, while in the 1970s it was as much as 90 percent.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The monk seal is protected across its range and is listed on CITES Appendix I. It is also listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Most of the monk seals in the northern Hawaiian Islands live in protected areas, such as the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument.  Conservation action includes the removal of trash from beaches, and the control of tourist activities on breeding beaches. There is considerable regulation of fishing boats in areas near the seals. There has been a slight increase in numbers of monk seals around the main Hawaiian Islands, but elsewhere the population continues to decline and the species is considered to be at risk of becoming extinct.  </p>
