<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Mandrill</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Mandrillus sphinx</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: males up to 32 inches (80 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> males up to 80 pounds (36 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The largest of the monkeys, mandrills are a multi-colored wonder. They have a remarkable long, flatish, red-and-blue face, an orange-yellow beard, thick brown hair, and a bright red, pink, and blue bottom. The colors are brighter in the males than the females. Mandrills live in groups called troops or hordes, some troops comprise over 900 individuals. They are noisy animals, making loud screams and barks as they wander through the rain forest. Mandrills sleep in the trees but hunt on the ground for small mammals and insects. They also eat seeds, leaves, fruit, frogs, ants, and flowers. Inside their mouth are two pouches, or pockets, where they can store food for later. These big monkeys can be very scary to look at, and when threatened will stretch out their arms and open their mouths wide to show off their enormous sharp teeth. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests in West Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for about 7 months and give birth to a single young. They breed about every 18 months.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 46 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are two main threats to the survival of mandrills&#8212;hunting and deforestation. Many mandrills are killed every year for their meat. The large, noisy troops are easily found in their rain forest homes, and often hunters will kill the whole troop using high-powered rifles. Today, the highly prized meat is transported in refrigerated trucks across the African continent to countries such as Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their rain forest habitat is being cleared, too, for farmland, roads, and new settlements.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The international trade of mandrills is banned, but it is very difficult to protect these monkeys in their remote forests, and, as a result, trade continues within Africa. Logging of their habitat continues too, so the outlook for the mandrill is bleak. Conservation organizations are working to save their habitat, and also to reduce the bushmeat trade. There are some captive breeding programs involving mandrills. </p>
