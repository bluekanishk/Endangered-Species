<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bactrian camel</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Camelus bactrianus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 12 feet (3.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 8 feet (2.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1,540 pounds (700 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Bactrian camels have two humps, which immediately distinguishes them from dromedaries, which only have one hump. The bactrian has long legs and a thick, shaggy winter coat that is shed in summer. Fat stored in its humps is used when food is scarce. When this happens the humps shrink in size. This camel is well adapted to life in the desert&#8212;its nostrils close during sand storms, and it has long eyelashes to protect its eyes from desert dust and sand. It lives in a herd and will eat anything, including meat, but its usual diet is tough, desert vegetation.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 1,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Deserts of northwest China and Mongolia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 3&#8211;5 years old. They are pregnant for 13 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 30&#8211;40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>In the last 20 years, the numbers of wild bactrian camels have almost halved. The main threat to the species comes from habitat loss. Increasingly it is competing with herds of introduced livestock for water and grazing. Many farmers kill the camels so there is more food for their own animals. Mining and other industrial developments are also a threat. In some areas domesticated bactrian camels are living close to the wild ones, and this may lead to cross-breeding and loss of the true wild camel. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The bactrian camel is a migratory species, which means it moves from area to area, so protecting it is difficult. The governments of China and Mongolia have created two huge reserves in the Great Gobi Desert to protect the camels and other desert animals. There is also a captive-breeding program in Mongolia where wild camels live in a fenced desert area. This project is helping to increase the number of true wild bactrians as well as providing valuable information about their behavior.  </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>A camel can see with its eyes closed&#8212;well almost! It has a third eyelid that protects its eyes during heavy, desert storms. When it's closed the extra eyelid moves from side to side like a automobile windshield wiper, clearing the eye of sand. It is transparent, so the camel can keep moving with the eyelid closed.</p>
