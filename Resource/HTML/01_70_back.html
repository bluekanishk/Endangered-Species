<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Philippine tarsier</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Tarsius syrichta</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 inches (16 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Tail length</b>: up to 10.6 inches (27 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 6 ounces (165 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This amazing-looking primate has the biggest eyes relative to its body weight of any mammal. It has a small body with long back legs, shorter front legs, and a long, hairless tail with a tuft of hair at the end. Its silky fur varies in color from orange to brown. It has very long, knobbly fingers and toes that help it to grip branches as it leaps through the trees. The tarsier rests during the day and searches for insects, lizards, birds, and bats to eat at night.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 1,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rain forests and mangroves in the Philippines  </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2 years old. They are pregnant for 6 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The tarsier is threatened by the loss of much of the remaining rain forests in which it lives. The rain forests have been cleared for timber, fuel, farmland, and for settlements. Tarsiers have also been hunted for food. Sadly, they are popular pets, and many are captured illegally to be sold to the pet trade. Some have also been killed by pet cats.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Philippine tarsier is listed on CITES Appendix II and is protected across its range. However, much tighter controls are needed to prevent hunting and to stop the pet trade. Most of the remaining rain forests are protected. Although it prefers undisturbed rain forest, tarsiers have been found in forests where the trees have grown back and even in gardens and parks. Organizations, such as The Tarsier Foundation, are working with local communities to save the tarsier from extinction. </p>
