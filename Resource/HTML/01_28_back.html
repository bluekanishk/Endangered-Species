<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Caribbean manatee</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Trichechus manatus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1,320 pounds (600 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These large mammals spend all their time in the water. They are round, heavy animals with a flipper on either side of their body and a paddle-shaped tail. They have tough, wrinkled, gray skin. One of the manatee's closest relatives is the elephant. Manatees are slow-moving, and usually only swim up to 3&#8211;5 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour). They have to swim to the surface every three to five minutes to breathe, but when resting they may spend up to 20 minutes on the seabed. They can close their nostrils when they are under the water. Manatees are herbivores and eat seagrass and other underwater vegetation.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 4,480</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Shallow, slow-moving rivers, saltwater bays, canals, and coastal areas from Florida along the east coast of Central America and north coast of South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 5 years old. They are pregnant for about 1 year and give birth to 1 calf. They breed every 2&#8211;5 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 60 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to manatees is people. Being large and generally slow-moving they are easy to hunt and each animal supplies a lot of meat. Many have been killed or injured in collisions with boats, and this is a major threat in areas such as Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has recorded more than 1,700 deaths due to collisions, and most were leisure vessels. Others have swallowed fishing hooks or eaten plastic trash. Habitat loss is another threat because manatees are being squeezed into smaller areas where they cannot find enough clean water with enough waterweed to eat.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Until recently little was known about the behavior of manatees, but the use of radio tracking has enabled scientists to learn about their movements. Fortunately, manatees have protection in most countries. In the U.S., it is illegal to capture, kill, or disturb manatees. There are speed restrictions on boats in manatee habitats, and safe areas where vessels are banned. There are a number of manatee sanctuaries in Florida and other states, too. In Africa, the West African manatees are protected in 38 countries. Amazonian manatees have been protected since 1973. Some marine parks rescue and care for injured and sick manatees, and then release them back into the wild.</p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Manatees have so-called "marching molars." Their molars, the large grinding teeth at the back of the mouth, move gradually toward the front of the jaw as they are worn down. Eventually they drop out and are replaced by a new molar. </p>
