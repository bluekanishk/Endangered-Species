<p><b>Bat-eared fox</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Octocyon megalotis</i></p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These little foxes have a pale yellow-brown coat and huge ears that are like those of a bat. They eat mainly insects, such as termites and grasshoppers, but also eat eggs, small mammals, lizards, birds, and fruit. They pair for life, and pairs live in small groups where they groom each other, play, and sleep together. Their large ears can be up to 5 inches (12 centimeters) long, and help them to stay cool in the hot deserts. They have exceptionally good hearing, and can hear the sounds made by insects underground. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These foxes are hunted for their fur, which is used locally to make blankets for winter. Farmers also kill them because they believe the foxes pose a threat to their livestock, which is not the case. Bat-eared foxes are often mistaken for the black-backed jackal, which does attack livestock and is hunted by dogs. These foxes are also under threat from diseases carried by domestic dogs, in particular parvovirus and rabies. Their numbers have fallen during recent droughts. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are healthy populations of bat-eared foxes in National Parks, such as Etosha National Park in Namibia and Kruger National Park in South Africa. Unfortunately, little is known about the behavior of the bat-eared fox, and until this is improved managing the remaining wild foxes will be difficult. There are some groups of bat-eared foxes in captivity. </p>
