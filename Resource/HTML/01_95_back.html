<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Tasmanian devil</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Sarcophilus harrisii</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 35.5 inches (90 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Tasmanian devils are the biggest marsupials, and get their name from the blood-curdling screech they make. They have a strong body with a black coat with white markings on their chest, a big head with powerful jaws, bone-crushing teeth, and a short thick tail. They sleep in burrows during the day and hunt at night. Although they will catch live prey, Tasmanian devils prefer to scavenge and use their strong sense of smell to sniff out a dead animal. They can roam for up to 10 miles (16 kilometers) each night in search of food.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Throughout Tasmania&#8212;an island off the southern coast of Australia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 3 weeks, and give birth to up to 20 young, but only 4 will survive as the female can only suckle 4 young at any time. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 5&#8211;6 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>For a long time Tasmanian farmers hunted the devils because they felt they threatened their livestock, especially chickens. The forests they lived in were cleared as settlers cut down trees for timber and new farmland. By the 1940s, Tasmanian devils were so rare that they were given protection and their numbers recovered. Today, the main threat to their survival comes from a fatal contagious disease called Devil Facial Tumor Disease. This is an infectious cancer that has already killed up to 90 percent of the devils in some areas. Other devils are killed by red foxes, and on the roads.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Tremendous efforts are being made to conserve the Tasmanian devil, which could be extinct in 25 years if they fail. In 2003, Save the Tasmanian Devil Program was launched, which is studying the impact of the disease on the devils and researching methods to control its spread. However, there is a strong possibility that the disease will wipe out the devils, so captive breeding groups are being set up using disease-free animals, and in time these animals could be released into disease-free areas.</p>
