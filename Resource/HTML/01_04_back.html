<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>African wild ass</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Equus africanus</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 4 feet (1.45 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 606 pounds (275 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These asses have a short, smooth, light gray to brown coat, with white underparts and a black stripe across the back. They have big, upright ears and a short, tufty mane formed from hairs that stand up. There are two sub species of African wild ass: the Nubian and the Somali wild ass. The Somali ass has stripes on the lower parts of its legs, like a zebra. The asses live alone or in mixed groups of males and females; these groups change all the time. African wild asses graze on grasses and other vegetation, and can survive for several days at a time without water.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 570</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Stony deserts, scrubland, and grassland in northeast Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia in Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 3&#8211;4 years old. They are pregnant for 12 months and give birth to a single foal. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The African wild ass has long been hunted for its meat and this has reduced its numbers over the years. In addition, there are increasing numbers of herds of livestock that compete with the wild ass for grazing and water. Grazing is in short supply on the arid grasslands in desert areas where it lives, and when there are too many animals, overgrazing and soil erosion results. Another problem comes from breeding the African wild ass with domesticated donkeys, and creating hybrids. This makes it difficult for conservationists to identify the pure wild ass.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Wild asses are protected in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, but enforcement of the law is poor. The conflict between the farmers and the wild asses needs to be stopped in order to save the remaining herds, and there are education programs in place that aim to do this. Also, the remaining herds need better protection and better management of their grazing lands. There are not many protected areas where the wild asses can graze, so the establishment of protected areas is important. There are some wild asses in captive breeding programs, and a small herd in the Yotvata Hai-bar Nature Reserve in Israel.</p>
