<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Bottlenose dolphin</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Tursiops truncatus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 13 feet (4 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 650 pounds (275 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The bottlenose dolphin is the largest of the beaked dolphins, with a light to dark gray top and pale gray underside. They have a high, curved dorsal fin on their back. They feed on fish, crustaceans, and squid, and often gather near fishing boats to feed on the fish being caught in the nets. Bottlenose dolphins are highly intelligent, lively, sociable animals, and can be seen leaping out of the water or standing upright in the water on their tails. They live in small groups called pods. Dolphins need to come to the surface to breathe air about every two minutes. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 600,000 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>All tropical seas and oceans</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 5&#8211;10 years old. They are pregnant for 12 months and give birth to a single calf</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The numbers of bottlenose dolphins have declined for many reasons. Water pollution from chemicals, sewage, and plastic waste, affects their health, while noise pollution from shipping disturbs them. Dolphins often swim with shoals of tuna, and fishermen locate the tuna by looking for dolphins. It has been estimated that over 7 million dolphins of various species may have drowned in fishing nets. Hunting is also a threat, and many dolphins are killed for their meat and oil. Bottlenose dolphins are still being caught and sold to aquariums and other tourist attractions. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>As a result of public pressure, the tuna fisheries now operate "dolphin friendly" fishing procedures, such as line fishing, or use large nets only when there is no sign of dolphins in the area. However, there are still concerns that dolphins are being harmed. It is now illegal to kill or injure a bottlenose dolphin in the waters of many countries. In the UK, two marine Special Areas of Conservation are being established to protect dolphins in Cardigan Bay (Wales) and the Moray Firth (Scotland). </p>
