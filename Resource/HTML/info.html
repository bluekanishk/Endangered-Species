<h3>SUPPORTING CONSERVATION</h3>
<p>Smart Cat Creative is currently supporting the following organizations that are helping to save endangered animals: </p>
<h4>Panthera</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.panthera.org/mission" title="http://www.panthera.org/mission">http:// www.panthera.org/ mission</a></p>
<p>Panthera funds scientific research into lions, tigers, jaguars, snow leopards, leopards, cougars, and cheetahs. This research provides essential knowledge that will help save these animals. Panthera also supports the work of a number of small organizations, such as Living with Lions.  </p>

<h4>Tusk</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.tusk.org/" title="http://www.tusk.org/">http://www.tusk.org/</a></p>
<p>Tusk was set up in 1990, when there was a huge poaching crisis in Southern Africa, and elephants and rhinos were in urgent need of help. Since that time, millions of dollars have been raised to fund projects across Africa that have helped more than 36 endangered species. Many of the projects involve working with local communities, helping to reduce conflict between people and wildlife, and often providing local jobs. </p>
