<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These handsome looking wolves are now one of the rarest members of the dog family in the world. They have a short, red coat with gray and black markings, long legs, and a tail with a black tip. Red wolves are very sociable and live in family packs of a male and female and their young. Generally pairs mate for life. Both the male and female look after the pups and are helped by the rest of the pack. Red wolves rest during the day and hunt at night for small mammals, such as rabbits and racoons. They will also eat deer, berries, and insects.</p>

<p>About 100</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Swamps, wetlands, and wet forests in southeastern United States</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They are pregnant for about 2 months and give birth to 2&#8211;8 pups. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 6&#8211;7 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This wolf was hunted for much of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries because it was a threat to livestock. It was also killed for its fur, and its forest homes cleared to make way for farmland and settlements. In addition, some red wolves bred with the coyote and grey wolf, creating hybrid red wolves in the population. By the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century the red wolf was declared extinct in the wild. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The conservation of the red wolf has been a success story. The species was saved from complete extinction when a small number of wild red wolves were caught and kept in three captive breeding centers, including Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington. These wolves have bred well, with the first pups being born in 1977. In 1985, a small number of red wolves were released back into the wild at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina. Today, there are more than 200 animals in captive breeding centers, and about 100 in the wild. The conservation organizations worked closely with national parks and the public in the release areas to ensure the released animals were not harmed. </p>
