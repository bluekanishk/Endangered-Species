<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Dhole</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Cuon alpinus</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3 feet (90 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 20 inches (50 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 44 pounds (20 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These wild Asian dogs have a thick, rusty-red coat with white markings on their undersides, a bushy, black tail, and big ears filled with white hair. They live in packs of males and females. Only the dominant female breeds, but all members of the pack help her to care for the pups. Dholes hunt as a pack, and will track and kill deer and wild sheep. Dholes can kill prey over 10 times their own body weight.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Grasslands and forests of India, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, China, and Russia </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 1 year old. They are pregnant for 2 months and give birth to 3&#8211;10 pups. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 16 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Dholes have suffered from loss of habitat across their range. For example, in Vietnam there are not many areas of forest left and the remaining fragments are separated from each other by farmland and settlements. Another problem is the lack of prey animals for dholes to hunt, and often they are in competition with other predators. Indian and Southeast Asian dholes are hunted, trapped, or poisoned. Also dholes catch diseases carried by domestic dogs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>In countries such as Cambodia, India, and Russia, dholes are protected by law and hunting is prohibited. Project Tiger in India has established many tiger reserves and these have helped the dhole, because dholes are often found living in the same habitats as tigers. In parts of Cambodia, domestic dogs are not allowed to enter protected areas to reduce any spread of disease to the dholes. There are some captive breeding programs, but no dholes have been released back into the wild as yet. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Dholes can jump up to 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) off the ground. Some have also been seen standing on their front legs and peeing at the same time, but scientists do not know why they do this. </p>
