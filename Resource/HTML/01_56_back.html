<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Kirk's red colobus monkey</b> <br/>also called Zanzibar red colobus </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Piliocolobus kirkii</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Body length</b>: up to 25.5 inches (65 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 25 pounds (11 kilograms)</p>
<p><b>Tail length</b>: up to 30 inches (77 centimeters)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Kirk's red colobus is one of the smallest members of the colobine monkey family. It was first spotted by Sir John Kirk on the island of Zanzibar during the 1860s. The monkey has a dark red to black coat, white hair around its face, and a very long tail. Unlike all other monkeys, it does not have thumbs, and its hands curve so they can easily hook on to branches as it swings through the trees. The monkeys usually live in small groups consisting of one male, and several females and their young. They eat mainly leaves and have a special stomach that can hold food up to a quarter of their body weight, so that it can be digested later. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 1,000&#8211;1,200</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests of Zanzibar&#8212;an island off the coast of Tanzania, East Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for about 5 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown; up to 20 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>This monkey is rapidly losing much of its habitat, especially forest and mangrove swamp. Forests are cleared for timber, charcoal, farmland, and settlements. Some of the protected forests have been damaged too, by illegal logging. In addition, some monkeys have been shot for bushmeat, while others have died on the roads. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Kirk's red colobus monkey is listed on CITES Appendix I so there is no international trade. About half of the remaining population is found in one small, protected area, Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park on Zanzibar, which is popular with tourists. It is hoped that additional parks will be established in the south of the island, and that wildlife corridors will be set up to link the remaining fragments of forest. About 200 monkeys have been moved to the Masingini Catchment Forest on Zanzibar to establish to a new colony there, but it is too early to tell if it has been successful.</p>
