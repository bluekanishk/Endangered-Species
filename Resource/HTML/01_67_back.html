<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Noctule bat</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Nyctalus noctula</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 0.55 inches (1.4 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 1.6 inches (4 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1.4 ounces (40 grams)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These are one of the largest bats to be found in Europe. They have short, reddish-brown fur and broad ears. Bats have good eyesight but they hunt at night and so rely on echolocation to detect prey, such as moths and other flying insects. Bats send out a high frequency noise called ultrasound that humans cannot hear. When this noise hits an object, echoes bounce back to the bats. This way they build up a picture of their surroundings, including the prey. During the day most bats roost in trees&#8212;they sleep in huge groups, hanging upside down with their wings wrapped around them.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Least concern</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Woodlands and open ground, such as parks, large gardens, and wetlands, throughout England, Wales, and across Europe</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 1 or 2 years old. They give birth to 1 or 2 young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Noctule bats have suffered from the loss of habitats where they hunt insect-rich woodland edges, woodland pasture, hedgerows, and meadows. They like to roost in hollow trunks of old trees, but the cutting down of trees that are considered unsafe means there are fewer sites for bats. These bats are also affected by pesticides. Pesticides are used to kill insect pests, and then the bats eat the insects that have been sprayed. As a result, noctule bats are particularly scarce in areas where there is intensive farming.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>More research is being carried out so that key roosting sites can be identified and, where necessary, artificial roosts constructed. The conservation of wildlife habitats on farms is essential, and this has been helped by European Union grants to pay farmers who improve the wildlife habitats on their land. The protection of old trees and woodlands is also important. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Noctule bats can reach flying speeds of up to 31 miles per hour (50 kilometers per hour). This allows them to hunt fast-flying moths. </p>
