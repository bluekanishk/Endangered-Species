<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Lar gibbon</b> <br/>also called the white-handed gibbon</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Hylobates lar</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 26 inches (66 centimeters)  </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 17.5 pounds (8 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Lars have brown or black fur with a frame of white around their face, and white hands and feet. They have long arms and legs, and move quickly and easily through the trees. They often walk along branches with their arms raised above their head for balance. Lars very rarely come down to the ground. They make a loud whooping noise that can be heard from great distances. They live in small, family groups, and eat leaves, shoots, flowers, insects, eggs, and occasionally birds.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical forests in South China, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaya, and Sumatra</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 9 years old. They are pregnant for 8 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 2&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25&#8211;30 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to the lar comes from the extensive deforestation of its habitat. Its tropical rain forest is being cleared at an alarming rate to supply timber and fuel, and to make way for new rubber and oil palm plantations. The forests are becoming increasingly fragmented and the lars isolated. In some areas, they are killed for bushmeat. Gibbons are popular pets in Southeast Asia and many female gibbons are shot down from the trees so that their babies can be caught and sold as pets.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The lar gibbon is listed on CITES Appendix I, so that it cannot be traded internationally. However, the best way to save this species is to protect the tropical rain forests where it lives. There are some rain forest national parks, but they are located in remote areas where it is difficult to prevent poaching and illegal logging. A number of gibbons are kept in captivity where they have been bred successfully, for example in the Durrell Zoo on the island of Jersey. </p>
