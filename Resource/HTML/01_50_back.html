<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Hippopotamus</b></p>
<p><b>Latin:</b> <i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i>  </p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 14 feet (4.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> Up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 2 tons (1.8 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Hippos look ungainly and lumbering on land, but they are strong swimmers and divers. The name hippopotamus means "river horse." They have a heavy, round body with a thick, gray-brown skin, a large, broad head, and short legs. They have two long, razor-sharp canine teeth, called tusks, on their lower jaw that can grow up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) long, which they use for fighting. Hippos are closely related to whales, and are very well suited to life under water. They can close their ears and nostrils when below the surface, and walk or run quite gracefully along the riverbed for up to 5 minutes. When they want to resurface they fill their lungs with air and float to the top. Their feet are webbed. Baby hippos are born and suckled underwater. Hippos spend most of the day in the water keeping cool, and come on to land at night to graze on grasses, which are their main diet. Hippos live in groups called herds. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 140,000 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rivers and swamps in sub-Saharan Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 7&#8211;15 years old. They are pregnant for 8 months and give birth to 1&#8211;2 calves. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 45 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threats facing the hippo are habitat loss and being hunted for their meat and teeth. Hippo numbers have fallen by about 20 percent in the last 25 years. In countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, only 5 percent of the population remains. Hippos graze land close to rivers and many of these areas have been lost to farming. Their grazing brings the hippos into conflict with farmers who often shoot the animals illegally because they ruin their crops, especially during times of drought. Hippos are also hunted for their teeth, because the trade in hippo ivory is not banned, unlike elephant ivory. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are healthy populations of hippos in many national parks in East and Southern Africa where they are protected. Outside the protected areas conservation is more difficult because of the increasing number of people competing with the hippos for land for farming and for water. This is particularly bad during times of drought, and tackling the problem of the hippo-human conflict is a priority. The hippo is listed on CITES Appendix II which regulates the trade in legal hippo ivory. </p>
