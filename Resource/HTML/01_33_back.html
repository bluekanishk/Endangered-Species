<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Cotton-top tamarin</b> <br/>also called cotton-headed tamarin </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Saguinus oedipus</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1 pound (500 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>A member of the monkey family, the cotton-top tamarin has thick fur that is mainly white with a strip of mottled brown hair on its back, shoulders, neck, and tail. The tamarins spend most of their time in trees. They live in small groups, and during the day look for food such as fruit, berries, and small insects. Seeds of the fruit pass through them whole, so these monkeys are important in helping seed dispersal and making sure trees spread and are replaced. At night they all sleep together in the same tree draped over the branches. Unlike many other primates, all members of the group, including all the males, care for the young cotton-tops.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 6,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Tropical forests of North Columbia, South America</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 18&#8211;24 months. They are pregnant for 6 months and usually have twins. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 13&#8211;14 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to the cotton-headed tamarins is habitat loss. Vast tracts of rain forest have been cleared for timber, fuel, and new farmland. This deforestation has fragmented the population of tamarins, which has put the species at great risk. In the past, many were caught for use in medical research, but today the threat comes from the pet trade. Hundreds are trapped and sold, both in South America and elsewhere. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Tamarins are a protected species in Columbia, and the sale of the animals as pets is illegal. However, the laws are not enforced. Proyecto Titi is a conservation program that is studying the tamarins in their habitat to learn more about their needs. The conservationists are educating the local community about the importance of protecting the tamarins and how they can benefit from their conservation. Other projects are looking to introduce solar-powered cookers for local people in the area to use, which will reduce the demand for fuel and so reduce logging. There are captive breeding programs, and some tamarins have been released back into the wild.</p>
