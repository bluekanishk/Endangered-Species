<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Markhor</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Capra falconeri</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 6 feet (1.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 3.5 feet (1.1 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 245 pounds (110 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARCTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This shaggy goat has a long, gray coat during the winter, and a shorter coat in the summer. The males have a pair of twisting horns that can grow up to 5.3 feet (1.6 meters) long, a black beard, and a mane of long hair around their neck and throat. The females and young live in herds, and the males live alone. Markhors eat grass and shrubs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx 2,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>High rocky areas, gorges, forests, and meadows in Central Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2&#8211;3 years old. They are pregnant for 4&#8211;5 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 12&#8211;13 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main reason for the fall in numbers of markhors is hunting for their horns and meat. Markhors are also highly prized by trophy huntsmen because of the skill needed to track them down in the high mountains. In addition, markhors are suffering from loss of habitat and competition for grazing from livestock, such as sheep and goats, owned by local farmers. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Markhors are protected in most countries where they live, and they are listed on CITES, which bans any trade without a permit. In the 1980s, a community-based trophy-hunting scheme was set up to save the remaining markhors in Pakistan. The scheme allows a small number of markhor to be hunted each year. The permits are very expensive, about $32,000 each (over &#163;20,000), and the money made from this is used to support local communities. Numbers of markhor have also risen due to less poaching and better management of grazing lands. The local people understand that saving markhors means more money for the community.</p>
