		<h2 class="fish">NAME</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Leafy seadragon</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scientific name:</b>
			<i>Phycodurus eques</i>
		</p>
		<h2 class="fish">SIZE</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Length</b>: up to 12 inches (30 centimeters)</p>
		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>The leafy seadragon looks like a seahorse covered in seaweed! But it's actually a fish and it belongs to the same family as seahorses and pipefish. It has a long, thin body with defensive spines down the sides, a curved tail, and a long, pipe-like snout. Its scaly skin is usually an orange-brown color, but this can vary depending on its age, location, and diet. It has leaf-like growths down the length of its body that make it look like a piece of floating seaweed, and this camouflage helps to protect the seadragon from predators, such as larger fish. Leafy seadragons are seen alone or in pairs. They feed on plankton and other tiny sea animals by sucking them in through their snouts. </p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Estimated 700,000</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Near threatened</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>Rocky reefs, coastal areas, and sea grass meadows in shallow water in Southern Australia</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Seadragons are ready to breed when they are about 2 years old. Females lay about 120 eggs in a special area on the male's tail. The eggs are then fertilized. </p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>Unknown, 5&#8211;7 years in captivity</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>The main threat to leafy seadragons is the loss of their coastal habitat where there are kelp and sea grass beds. Water pollution is also affecting their habitat, especially from sewage and oil. Also, seadragons are collected from the wild for sale to the pet trade. </p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>Little is known about the leafy seadragon, so more research is being carried out. In Australia, divers are asked to report their sightings of the fish&#8212;the number of adults and youngsters, where they were seen and at what depth. A database has been put together using the information from the sightings, and conservationists working to protect these fish are using it to help them to draw up a program to save the species.</p>

			<b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The male leafy seadragon looks after the eggs, not the female. He carries the eggs around in a "brood patch", which is under his tail, for about 4 weeks until they hatch and the baby seadragons swim away.</p>
