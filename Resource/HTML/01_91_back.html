<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Striped hyena</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Hyaena hyaena</i></p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Although hyenas look like dogs, they are actually more closely related to cats and civets. The striped hyena has a pale gray, to beige, shaggy coat with black stripes and a long, bushy tail. Its front legs are longer than its back legs and its back slopes down. When it is excited, it can raise the long hairs of its mane, which runs along its back, so that it looks much larger. Hyenas are well known as scavengers, and help to keep their habitat disease-free and clean of dead and rotting carcasses. They live alone, in pairs, or in small groups. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Savanna and desert in North and East Africa, the Middle East, Arabia, and northern India</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 2 or 3 years old. They are pregnant for 2 or 3 months and give birth to between 1 and 5 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;12 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The striped hyena is an unpopular and often feared animal that has been hunted and killed across its range. Many were poisoned in the Middle East between the First and Second World Wars when there was a campaign to eliminate the golden jackal because it carried rabies. Then there were further campaigns in the 1970s. Poisoned bait was hidden in the bodies of dead donkeys and, because the hyena is a scavenger, it ate the bait. Although the incidences of rabies fell, the numbers of striped hyenas also fell. Today, the striped hyena is hunted in countries such as Morocco, where its body parts are used in traditional medicines. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>A great deal of research is needed to learn more about this animal. Many of the remaining striped hyenas are found in protected areas, such as the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, but outside these areas the hyenas frequently come into conflict with people, especially farmers, who believe wrongly, they kill their animals. More education is needed to teach local people about striped hyenas and to help improve their opinion of the animals. </p>
