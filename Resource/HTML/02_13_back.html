<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Kakapo</b> <br/>also called owl parrot</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Strigops habroptila</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 8.8 pounds (4 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Kakapos are the only flightless parrots in the world and the largest. They have soft, green feathers mottled with brown and yellow, which is excellent camouflage when they are on the ground. They have a unique way of mating. The males gather in an area called a lek and attract females with a loud booming noise. The females then inspect the males and choose the partner they want. Mating only occurs when a certain tree has its best growth of fruits, which can be every 5 years or so. Kakapos are nocturnal, and awake at night to feed on roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. They live on the ground but can climb trees to reach food.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 130 </p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and shrublands in New Zealand</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are 9&#8211;10 years old. They lay 2&#8211;3 eggs that hatch after about 30 days. They breed every 2&#8211;5 years.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 60 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The kakapo has been hunted for its meat and feathers for more than 700 years, first by the Maoris and then by Europeans during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The Maoris used kakapo skin with feathers to make decorative cloaks. Over the last 200 years there has been continued clearance of its forest habitat for farmland, and introduced animals such as cats, dogs, rats, and stoats have killed the flightless kakapo. Also, deer and possums have been introduced and they compete with the kakapo for food. By 1995, there were thought to be only 50 kakapos left in the wild.</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Kakapo Recovery Programme was set up to save the kakapo. It was decided that the best chance for the bird was to establish predator-free islands. Two islands, Codfish Island and Anchor Island, off the southern tip of South Island, New Zealand, were selected and they are now free of rats and home to a number of kakapo. There are plans to clear much larger islands that can support more of these birds. One day it is hoped that kakapos will be reintroduced to the mainland. The population stands at about 130 birds, of which half are young birds.</p>
