<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Przewalski's horse</b> </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Equus ferus przewalskii</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 83 inches (210 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 750 pounds (350 kilograms)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 56 inches (142 centimeters), 14 hands</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>This is a stocky, round horse with a light brown coat and cream underbelly. It has a long, dark tail and dark legs, and a short, dark mane, which stands upright. Their coat is very thick, giving them protection against the cold, winter weather. All wild horses are believed to be descended from the Przewalski's horse, the only true species of wild horse in the world today. They live in herds consisting of one male (stallion), and several mares (females). They eat grass and other plants. </p>


<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Over 400 </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Semi-desert scrublands of Mongolia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females are pregnant for 11 or 12 months and give birth to a single foal. They breed every 1 or 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, about 20 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These horses became extinct in the wild in the 1960s, mostly as a result of hunting. Another reason for their decline was the introduction of herds of livestock on to their grazing grounds. The grasslands on which the horses grazed were used by herdsmen for their goats and sheep, and this lead to competition for food and water. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there were about 300 Przewalski's horses in captivity in zoos and wildlife parks. These animals were carefully bred until there were enough to start reintroducing them back into the wild. This started in 1990, when a small herd was released in Hustai National Park in Central Mongolia. Now there is a herd of horses in Hustai and another in a protected area of southwest Mongolia. The horses have learned to survive in the tough environment and to cope with the largest predators, wolves.  The horses are attracting tourists to the area, which is helping the local people. </p>
