<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Leatherback turtle</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Dermochelys coriacea</i></p>




<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 5 feet (1.6 meters)   </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 1,323 pounds (601.3 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The leatherback is the largest and heaviest of all the turtle species. Instead of a bony shell, its carapace is flexible and covered in a layer of leathery skin. The carapace is dark brown to gray in color, with white and pink spots. It has seven ridges running down its length. Leatherbacks feed on jellyfish and other soft-bodied creatures, and can dive to 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) in search of food. They can eat their own body weight in jellyfish in one day, and have special spikes in their throat to help them swallow the slippery food. Sadly, they often swallow plastic bags mistaking them for jellyfish, and these can kill them.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 30,000</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Open seas and tropical sandy beaches (for egg laying) worldwide</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Every 3&#8211;4 years the females return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs. They haul themselves onto the beach at night, and use their back flippers to dig holes in the sand. They lay 4&#8211;10 clutches of 100 eggs during the nesting season, which lasts for about 3 months. The females cover the eggs with sand and head back to the ocean. The eggs take about 60&#8211;70 days to hatch. </p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 45 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are a number of threats to the future survival of the leatherback turtle. Many of their nesting beaches have been destroyed or disturbed due to tourism and coastal development, and in some places the eggs are collected and sold as a delicacy. Other turtles die in fishing nets or are injured by ships. Pollution is another threat, from oil spills or because the turtles often eat plastic trash in the ocean. However, the greatest threat is probably global warming. As the sea levels rise, the leatherbacks' nesting beaches are more likely to be eroded or lost all together. </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The leatherback is listed on CITES Appendix I, and is protected through much of its range. Many of its main nesting beaches are protected, for example those in Las Baulas National Park, Costa Rica. In other places, the eggs are collected and hatched so that the hatchlings can be returned directly to the ocean. The U.S. government has set up Leatherback Conservation Areas in the North Pacific where no long-line fishing is allowed during certain times of year.  </p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The sex of the newly born turtles depends on how hot the sun is when the eggs are incubating. Hotter nests result in female turtles, while cooler nests result in males.</p>
