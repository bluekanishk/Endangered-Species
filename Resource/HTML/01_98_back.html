<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>White rhinoceros</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Ceratotherium simum</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 14 feet (4.2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 6 feet (1.9 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 4 tons (4 tonnes)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The white rhino has a massive, heavy body, with a slight back hump, and four stumpy legs. Its thick, wrinkled skin is grayish brown, just like other rhinos and not white, as its name would suggest. The rhino has two horns at the front of its face, one slightly shorter than the other. The horns are huge, up to 48 inches (122 centimeters) long, and are used for fighting off predators and digging in the soil. They eat mainly leaves and grass. Heavy and lumbering, the rhino can run at fast bursts of speed to frighten off enemies. White rhinos mostly live alone, although small groups of females and young are sometimes formed. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 18,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Near threatened</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa, where it feeds on grasses</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are around 6&#8211;7 years old. They are pregnant for 16 months and give birth to a single calf. They breed every 2&#8211;4 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main cause for the decline of the white rhino has been hunting for its horn, which is used to make ornamental dagger handles and in traditional Chinese medicines. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the southern white rhino was reduced to just 200 animals. Since then the population has increased slowly. However, poaching continues, and in 2011 reached the highest level since 1988, with at least 443 animals killed in South Africa alone. This was due to the rise in the value of the horn, which is worth a staggering $30,000 per pound (0.45 kilograms). As well as poaching, the white rhino is facing the loss of its habitat as human populations increase and move into the remaining grasslands. The northern white rhino is believed to be extinct in the wild.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Trade in rhinos and their products have been banned, and rhinos are protected across their range. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of many conservationists in southern Africa, the southern white rhino was saved from extinction and the population reached 18,000. It is now the most abundant rhino species in the world. This has been achieved by establishing national parks and game reserves where rhinos and other animals are protected. The captive breeding of rhinos has been successful too, with reintroductions to the wild. However, the recent increase in poaching means that many rhinos have to be guarded by armed patrols or have their horns removed so that poachers do not kill them. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>The rhinoceros's huge horn is not made from ivory, like the tusks of an elephant. Instead it is made from keratin, the same substance that forms our hair and nails, horse's hooves, and bird's beaks.  </p>
