<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Green turtle</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Chelonia mydas</i></p>




<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: of shell up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 661 pounds (300 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Green turtles are named for the green color of fat under their shell. They have a flatish, greenish-brown shell and large front flippers that they move in a figure of 8 movement when they swim. The males have a longish tail. They have a small head, and their serrated jaw helps them to tear off vegetation to eat. Green turtles swim long distances across the oceans between their feeding areas and nesting beaches. When they are ready to lay their eggs, the females arrive at the nesting beach at night. They make a burrow on the beach where they lay their eggs and cover them with sand. They then head back to the ocean. When the eggs hatch, the young turtles race for the sea, but crabs and seabirds eat many of the young before they reach the water. </p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Estimated 88,000 nesting females  </p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Near the coastlines and islands of tropical oceans around the world and the Mediterranean Sea</p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>The females lay 100&#8211;200 eggs that hatch after 6&#8211;8 weeks. They lay eggs every 2&#8211;4 years. </p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Over 80 years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Green turtles were hunted for their meat, oil, shell, and skin. Their eggs were collected, too. The turtles were easy to catch when the females hauled themselves onto beaches to lay their eggs. Today, there are several serious threats to the survival of this species. Many green turtles are caught in fishing nets, killed by water pollution, injured by boat propellers, and harmed by plastic trash. Some are dying from a new disease called fibropapilloma, which is linked to pollution. Female green turtles swim for miles across oceans to return to the beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. Unfortunately, many of the turtles' nesting beaches have been destroyed by the construction of hotels and other developments, and the females are disturbed by lights and noise when they come ashore to lay their eggs. </p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The green turtle is protected in many parts of its range, and the trade in turtles and their products is illegal. However, in some places turtle eggs are a delicacy and this is threatening the survival of local populations. Many of the most important nesting beaches have been protected, for example the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. Several conservation organizations boost the number of hatchlings by collecting the eggs. These eggs are moved to a safe place to hatch and then the hatchlings are released directly into the sea. </p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Green turtles start out as carnivores and become vegetarians. Young turtles eat small jellyfish, fish, and crustaceans. Adult green turtles are vegetarian and eat plants found in the oceans, such as seagrass. </p>
