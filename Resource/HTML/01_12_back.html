<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Asiatic lion</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera leo persica</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 8.5 feet (2.5 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 550 pounds (250 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These lions have a sandy brown coat, and the males have a thick mane of long hair around their head and shoulders. Asiatic lions have a shaggier coat than African lions, and a longer tassel of hair on the end of their tail. They hunt pigs, cattle, antelope, and deer. The females do the hunting in groups. They stalk their prey, then charge and finally knock or drag it to the ground. Only about one in four charges results in a kill. Lions usually hunt in the early morning or evening when it is cooler. They then sleep and rest for up to 20 hours during the day.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 250&#8211;350  </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered  </p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Gir Forest, Gujurat, western India</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2&#8211;4 years old. They are pregnant for 3&#8211;4 months and give birth to 2&#8211;4 cubs. They breed every 2 years. Intruding lions may kill the cubs from a previous male in order to have their own cubs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Approx. 17 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Once the Asiatic lion ranged from northern India to the Middle East and Italy. Lions have long been hunted, and as the human populations in these areas increased, so did the number of lions being hunted and killed. Their habitat was lost, too, when forests were cleared for farmland. During the 19th century, hunting lions was a favorite sport of Indian royalty and the British living in India. By 1900, Asiatic lions had become extinct everywhere, except the Gir Forest in Gujurat. Fortunately, the Nawab of Junagadh, and later the British Administration, limited the numbers of lions killed and the population of the Gir Forest slowly increased. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Asiatic lions are still found in the Gir Forest. However, as their population has grown, they have become overcrowded. Some have left the safety of the forest and this has brought them into conflict with local farmers and villagers. Some lions have been killed by farmers, others have fallen into open wells or been killed on roads. There is concern that any natural disaster affecting the Gir Forest or disease could wipe out all the lions. Biologists working on the Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project are hoping to establish a second population in the Kuno Wildlife Refuge in Madhya Pradesh, central India. </p>
