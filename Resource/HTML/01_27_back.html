<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Cape mountain zebra</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Equus zebra</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 10.5 feet (315 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 5 feet (150 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 820 pounds (372 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Cape mountain zebras are the smallest of the zebra family. They have a black-and-white striped coat, but their belly is white with one broad, black stripe. Their hooves are exceptionally hard and pointed to help them climb mountains. They live in breeding herds with one male at the head of a group of females and their young, and also in "batchelor" herds with all males. Cape mountain zebras eat grass, leaves, and bark, and need to drink water every day. They have dust baths once or twice a day, which help to keep their skin free of small biting insects.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 1,200</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Desert, mountain, and rocky slopes in South Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 1 year and give birth to 1 foal. They breed every 1&#8211;3 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The Cape mountain zebra was endangered by hunting and from the loss of its habitat to farmland. By 1950, there were fewer than 100 of these zebra left and the species was on the brink of extinction. Since then numbers have increased slowly and there are now around 1,200 in the wild. Today, increasing numbers of livestock compete with the zebra for grazing. In drought years, the competition can be fierce and often farmers shoot the zebra so there is more food and water for their own animals. Zebras are also still killed for their meat and skin. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The zebra is listed on CITES Appendix I so international trade is banned. There are a number of national parks that are home to herds of mountain zebra, such as Mountain Zebra National Park in South Africa, where there are 300 animals. Mountain zebras have been reintroduced to some national parks too, including Karoo and Addo National Parks in South Africa. These zebras are also in captivity and in private game reserves.</p>
