<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Gray crowned crane</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Balearica regulorum</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 3.6 feet (110 centimeters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 6.5 feet (2 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 9 pounds (4 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>These wading birds have an oval-shaped body covered in mainly gray feathers, with white and black wing feathers, and gray feathers on their long necks. They have a fan or crest of golden feathers that stands upright on the very top of their heads. Gray crowned cranes are omnivorous and eat insects, lizards, fish, and grasses. Like other cranes, the gray crowned species like to dance. They jump up and down, toss grass and twigs in the air, flap their wings, run, bow, and bob their head up and down. Dancing is part of their courtship, but young cranes dance just for fun. The gray crowned crane is the national bird of Uganda.</p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Wetlands, grasslands, and savannas in eastern and southern Africa</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females begin to breed when they are about 2 years. They lay 2&#8211;3 eggs. Both males and females incubate the eggs for between 28&#8211;31 days.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 22 years</p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Crowned cranes are found in wetland habitats, a type of environment that is rapidly disappearing. Wetlands across Africa are being drained to make way for more farmland. The water levels in many other wetlands have reduced because water is being piped to settlements and used to irrigate fields. The disruption of wetlands means that the cranes cannot find enough insects to feed on, or suitable nesting sites. Other threats include the heavy use of pesticides and polluted water from surrounding areas.  </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The best way to ensure the survival of this crane is to protect the wetlands. The International Crane Foundation is working with communities to show them how important wetlands are to humans as well, to make sure they have enough water especially during times of drought. Communities are being taught that the wetlands will help reduce flooding and also provide natural resources, such as reeds and papyrus, that can be woven into baskets and other goods that can be sold for profit. </p>
