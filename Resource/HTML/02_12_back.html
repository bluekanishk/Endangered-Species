<h2 class="bir">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Japanese crane</b> <br/>also called red-crowned crane, or tancho in Japan</p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Grus japonensis</i></p>




<h2 class="bir">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Wingspan</b>: up to 8 feet (2.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 22 pounds (10 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="bir">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Japanese cranes are tall, elegant birds that have white body feathers with black feathers at the end of their wings. They have long, thin, black legs, a long, slender black neck, and a crown of red feathers on the top of their heads. They spend time on land as well as in the water, eating grasses, reeds, fruits, insects, small rodents, and fish. Pairs stay together for life. In Japan these birds are a symbol of good fortune and a long life. </p>

<h2 class="bir">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 2,200</p>

<h2 class="bir">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="bir">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Wetlands, marshes, and rivers of Russia, China, Mongolia, and Japan</p>

<h2 class="bir">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 3&#8211;4 years old. They lay two eggs and both the male and female incubate the eggs for 29&#8211;34 days. Usually only 1 chick survives.</p>

<h2 class="bir">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown; up to 70 years in captivity </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These beautiful birds were hunted in Japan and other countries for their feathers. The cranes have also suffered from loss of their wetland habitat, which is often drained for farmland and industrial development. As the wetlands have dried out, spring fires have become more common and these have destroyed the cranes' nests. Also, many birds have been poisoned by eating grain treated with pesticides. </p>

<h2 class="bir">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Cranes are now protected across most of their range and it is illegal to hunt them. However, there is a shortage of suitable habitats for breeding grounds. Efforts by conservation organizations, such as the International Crane Foundation, have led to breeding grounds in Japan and Siberia being protected. One of the largest nesting populations of cranes is found in Zhalong Nature Reserve in China, where research has helped in the conservation of cranes elsewhere. There are now a number of nature reserves protecting wetlands along the fly paths used by the cranes when they migrate from Siberia to eastern China and Japan.</p>
