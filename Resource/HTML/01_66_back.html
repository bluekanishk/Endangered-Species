<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Gorilla beringei</i></p>





<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gorillas are the world's largest primates, and have a big body with long, strong arms and a massive chest covered in long, thick, black hair. They have the thickest hair of all the gorilla species, which helps keep them warm in their mountain habitat. They walk on their hind feet and the knuckles of their hands. Mountain gorillas are herbivores and feed on over 100 different types of vegetation. They are powerful animals but shy and gentle and very sociable. They live in groups of around 11 individuals but there can be as many as 40. The group is led by a silverback, a dominant male, who has a silver stripe running down his back.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 800</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Mountain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 10 years old. They are pregnant for 8.5 months and give birth to a single young. They breed every 4 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 40&#8211;50 years</p>


<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>Poaching is a major threat, with gorillas being killed for their meat and for their babies, which are kept as pets by local people. The increasing human population means that more forests are being destroyed for timber and fuel. Some forests are cleared for mining. Many gorillas live in areas where there have been civil wars, and conflict in and around the forests has resulted in gorillas being killed. More recently there has been an increase in ecotourism, and although this brings money into local communities, the people bring diseases with them that spread to the gorillas. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are a number of National Parks that protect gorillas, such as Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda, Volcano National Park in Rwanda, and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In some areas the gorillas are protected by armed guards that patrol the forests. Community reserves are important, too. These are areas managed by the local people who are directly involved with protecting gorillas and other animals. Gorilla ecotourism brings in a lot of money and this encourages locals to protect the gorillas. Conservationists believe that tourism is important despite the risk of disease.</p>
