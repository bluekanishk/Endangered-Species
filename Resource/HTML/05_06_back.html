		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>Tiger sharks are one of the largest sharks in our oceans. They get their name because they have striped markings on the sides of their body, but these gradually disappear as the sharks mature and grow bigger. Their skin is blue-green to dark gray, with a pale underside. Tiger sharks have large jaws and sharp, serrated teeth. They live alone and prefer to hunt at night. They eat anything, including human trash that is dumped in the oceans.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Unknown</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Near threatened</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>Tiger sharks prefer murky water in rivers, harbors, and lagoons in tropical and warm oceans worldwide.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Females are ovoviviparous, and eggs develop inside the mothers for between 14 and 16 months. They give birth to between 10 and 82 pups. They breed every 3 years.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>About 30&#8211;40 years</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>One of the main threats to the tiger shark is overfishing. This shark is caught for its meat, fins, cartilage, and oil. Tiger sharks often become caught in commercial fishing nets, and take the bait on hooks meant for tuna and swordfish. Also, they are popular with game fishermen. The tiger shark is large and often aggressive so is much feared. It swims into shallow water where it comes into conflict with people, especially in tourist areas, so the tiger sharks are killed. Another threat comes from plastic garbage floating in the oceans, which the sharks are known to eat.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>The tiger shark has a widespread distribution, but there are very few places where it is protected, or where there are conservation action plans in place. In 2010, Greenpeace added tiger sharks to its seafood red list, a list of fish sold in shops which people should stop buying. Several conservation organizations are running campaigns to stop these sharks being killed for their fins, and to stop restaurants selling shark fin soup. </p>
