<h1 class="glo">HOW THE CARDS WORK</h1>
<p>These cards feature only a small handful of the thousands of species that are threatened. Each card provides information about a different animal, its appearance and biology, where it is found, the threats that it faces, and some of the ways that we can help to save it. The cards are divided into 6 categories:</p>
<p class="decksL"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(255,111,32);">Mammals</b> intelligent animals that are covered in hair. Most female mammals give birth to live young (apart from the echidna and platypus, that lay eggs), and they feed their young with milk. </p>
<p class="decksR"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(96,0,160);">Birds</b> have feathers covering most of their body. They use their wings to fly. They have two legs that they use to perch or run, and a beak (or bill) rather than teeth. Female birds lay eggs with hard shells. </p>
<p class="decksL"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(0,128,128);">Reptiles</b> are scaly-skinned animals, such as crocodiles and snakes. Most reptiles have four legs, but snakes and some lizards are legless. Some reptiles lay eggs, but others give birth to live young. </p>
<p class="decksR"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(255,51,156);">Amphibians</b> live in and near water. They have a moist skin. Most amphibians have four legs. Many lay eggs that hatch into tadpoles, and the tadpoles change into adults.</p>
<p class="decksL"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(0,120,255);">Fish</b> live in water and they breathe using gills. Their body is covered in scales. They have fins instead of arms and legs that they use to swim. </p>
<p class="decksR"><b class="colored" style="color:rgb(103,51,1);">Invertebrates</b> are animals that do not have a backbone, such as jellyfish, worms, and insects.</p>
