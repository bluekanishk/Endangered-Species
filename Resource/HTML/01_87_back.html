<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Snow leopard</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera uncia</i></p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 7.5 feet (2.3 meters)</p>
<p><b>Height:</b> up to 24 inches (60 centimeters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 121 pounds (55 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The fur of the snow leopard is white and silvery-gray with black splodges. Their coat is extremely thick and dense to help protect them in the freezing temperatures of their mountainous habitat. These leopards have very large paws, which act as snowshoes so that they can walk easily in deep snow. Snow leopards have an extremely long tail&#8212;nearly the same length as their body. They use the tail for balance when walking on narrow mountain ledges, or across fast-running mountain streams. They also sometimes wrap their thick, fluffy tail around their face for extra warmth when resting. Snow leopards are solitary animals, apart from females with young. They hunt large hoofed mammals such as the ibex, markhor, and wild sheep, as well as the smaller marmots, hares, and mice</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>4,500&#8211;7,500</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>High snowy mountains of Central Asia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 or 3 years old. They are pregnant for 13&#8211;15 weeks, and give birth to 2 or 3 cubs. They breed every 2 years.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>30&#8211;40 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to the snow leopard comes from poaching. Snow leopards have long been killed for their beautiful fur, and the killing continues today. However, they are also poached so their body parts can be used in traditional Chinese medicines. Some snow leopards are killed because they prey on farmers' livestock. Another threat is habitat loss. Farmers are moving their livestock higher up the mountains where the livestock competes with wild goats for food. If the wild goats starve and decline in number, the leopards go hungry and so kill livestock instead.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>It is very difficult to protect an animal that lives in remote areas where the people are poor and rely on farming for income. The conservation organizations involved in helping the snow leopard are working in partnership with local people, showing them ways of earning a living without threatening the snow leopards, for example by making wool into handicrafts, and providing accommodation for ecotourists. Sometimes farmers are compensated for the loss of any animal killed by the snow leopards. </p>
