<h2 class="rep">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Brother's Island tuatara</b> </p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Sphenodon guntheri</i></p>



<h2 class="rep">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 31 inches (80 centimeters) </p>

<h2 class="rep">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Tuataras are one of the world's oldest known reptiles&#8212;their ancestors lived on Earth 225 million years ago alongside the dinosaurs. Tuataras look like lizards and have thick, gray-green skin and a row of spines that stand up along their backs. The males are larger than the females and also have bigger spines. Tuataras eat small lizards, earthworms, spiders, and even small seabirds, and their eggs. They rest in a burrow or bask in the sun during the day and hunt at night. Tuataras are slow growers&#8212;they can be 35 years old before they reach their full size.</p>

<h2 class="rep">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Approx. 400</p>

<h2 class="rep">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="rep">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Forests and scrubland in North Brother's Island, New Zealand. Some are now found on Titi Island and Matiu Island, New Zealand </p>

<h2 class="rep">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 10&#8211;20 years old. They lay between 5&#8211;18 eggs&#8212;the eggs can take up to 15 months to hatch. They breed every 4 years.</p>

<h2 class="rep">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Up to 80&#8211;100 plus years</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The main threat to the survival of this reptile comes from introduced predators, especially rats, but also feral dogs and cats. Brother's Island is now rat-free, but it is feared that rats could spread from nearby islands or come in with boats visiting the island. Another threat to all tuataras is humans, as the tuatara is highly prized by reptile collectors, and poaching is threatening their survival. Climate change could also threaten the tuatara, because scientists have discovered that in temperatures over 64&#176;Fahrenheit (18&#176; Centigrade) only males will be produced.</p>

<h2 class="rep">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The key to the survival of all species of tuatara is to get rid of introduced predators, especially on the islands. On North Brother's Island, conservationists have collected some tuatara eggs from the wild and these have hatched in captivity. The hatchlings will be raised until they are large enough to be released into a safe place. In areas where there are plenty of these reptiles, some are caught and moved to where there are no tuataras or where the numbers are dangerously low. For example, in 1995, some Brother's Island tuataras were moved to other rat-free islands where they are breeding successfully. </p>

<p class="wow rep"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>Tuataras have a third eye in the middle of their foreheads. Scientists are not sure what this is for, but think it could be a light sensor rather than an actual eye. This third eye is covered by a thin later of scales a few months after birth.</p>
