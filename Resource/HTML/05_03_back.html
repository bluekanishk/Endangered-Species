		<h2 class="fish">NAME</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Great white shark</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Scientific name:</b>
			<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>
		</p>
		<h2 class="fish">SIZE</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Length</b>: up to 21 feet (6.4 meters) </p>
		<p>
			<b>Weight:</b> up to 7,495 pounds (3,400 kilograms)</p>
		<h2 class="fish">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
		<p>Great white sharks are not really white, but have a silver-gray or bronze upper body and a white underside. They have a streamlined shape, and a mouth full of sharp, serrated teeth. These sharks are very skilled hunters&#8212;they have an acute sense of smell and can detect electric currents in the water created by prey. These currents help them to pick up the position of the prey before it can be seen. Great whites are fast swimmers and swift attackers, however, they very rarely attack humans. They feed on turtles, fish, molluscs, and crustaceans.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
		<p>Approx. 3,500</p>
		<h2 class="fish">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
		<p>Vulnerable</p>
		<h2 class="fish">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
		<p>The world's oceans, mainly warmer waters</p>
		<h2 class="fish">BREEDING</h2>
		<p>Females breed when they are about 12&#8211;14 years old. They are ovoviviparous and give birth to 2&#8211;14 pups. They may have only 4&#8211;6 litters in a lifetime.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
		<p>Over 30 years</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
		<p>These sharks have an awesome reputation and people fear them. There are only about 10 percent of the numbers of great white sharks in the oceans now compared with 100 years ago. They are caught for their fins, meat, and skin. Even their teeth and jaws are valuable as they are sold as souvenirs. Many great whites are caught in fishing nets or killed because they are found too close to tourist beaches and people fear shark attacks. Great whites grow slowly and the females do not have young until they are about 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) long, so many females are killed before they have a chance to breed.</p>
		<h2 class="fish">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
		<p>Great white sharks are protected in many countries such as Australia, South Africa, and the United States, but it is a migratory species so international protection is needed. Some countries have established shark sanctuaries where shark fishing is banned, for example the huge sanctuary near the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. In places such as South Africa and Mexico, divers can go down in cages to watch the great whites. This, and other shark-watching activities, is boosting tourism and bringing money into local communities.  </p>
