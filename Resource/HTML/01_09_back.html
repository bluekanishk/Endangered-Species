<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Amur leopard</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera pardus orientalis</i> </p>




<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length:</b> up to 7 feet (2 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 106 pounds (48 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The Amur leopard is the most critically endangered of all the big cats in the world.</p>
<p>Amur leopards have a pale yellow-brown coat with spots that are more widely spaced than those of other leopard species. Their coat becomes extra thick in winter to help the animals survive the extreme cold and harsh conditions. The shaggy hairs are 2 inches (5 centimeters) longer than those of their summer coat, to provide additional protection. They hunt at night for badgers, hares, roe deer, sika deer, and other small mammals. They do not eat their entire kill at once, but will drag the carcass into a tree to finish later. Amurs live alone.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>About 35</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Critically endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Rocky ground and temperate forests in Russian Far East and northeast China </p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females begin to breed when they are about 3 years old. They are pregnant for 3&#8211;4 months and give birth to between 1&#8211;4 cubs. They breed every year.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 10&#8211;15 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>The Amur leopard was hunted almost to extinction for its fur and body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicines. By the 1980s very few remained in the wild. Today, there are several threats to the small number of leopards remaining in the wild. Their forest habitat has been cleared and damaged by forest fires. The leopards used to prey on large deer, which are also hunted by humans, and their numbers are now in decline. This forces the leopards to travel longer distances, and to turn to other prey. Often this means that they kill livestock such as cattle, sheep, and farmed deer instead, and this has brought them into conflict with farmers.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>The Amur leopard is protected and it is listed on CITES Appendix I. However, there are so few Amur leopards left in the wild that a disaster such as a fire or storm could wipe them out. They are found in a remote area where it is difficult to enforce anti-poaching laws and for patrols to operate. Education programs are essential to make sure the local people protect the leopards and their habitat. Farmers are compensated for any animals that are killed by the leopards, so that they do not shoot them. A new National Park has been proposed in China to protect the remaining Chinese Amur leopards. There are also a number of captive breeding programs. As a result of their success, there are plans to reintroduce some captive-bred animals into the wild. </p>
