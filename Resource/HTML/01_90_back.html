<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>The spectacled bear is the only species of bear to live in South America. It has thick, brown or black fur, and most have a pattern of white hair around their eyes, which is why they have been given the name spectacled bear. They live alone and eat fruits, berries, rodents, and insects. They have large flat teeth and strong jaws with which to chew tough vegetation and bark. They are shy bears that like to avoid any contact with humans.  </p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are between 14 and 24 months old. They are pregnant for 5&#8211;9 months and give birth to 1&#8211;3 cubs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>Unknown, up to 39 years in captivity</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>There are two main threats to the survival of the spectacled bear, the loss of their forest habitat in the Andes, and conflict with local farmers. More of the forest is being logged to supply timber and space for farmland. As their habitats are lost, so the spectacled bears are coming into greater conflict with people. They raid crops and occasionally kill cattle, so farmers shoot them. Some females are shot and their cubs sold as pets. These bears are also hunted for their meat, skin, fat and claws, and their gall bladders are prized for traditional Chinese medicines.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Many of the farmers in the Andes are living in poverty and are poorly educated. They cannot afford to lose their crops or cattle. Some conservation organizations are compensating farmers when this happens, to prevent the bears from being shot. Education programs in the area are teaching local people about the bears, and how they can live with them. Orphaned cubs are being rescued and, when they are old enough, they are being released back into the wild. There are some captive bears in zoos, which are part of the Species Survival Plan.</p>
