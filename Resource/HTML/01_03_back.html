<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>African lion</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Panthera leo</i> </p>



<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) </p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 495 pounds (225 kilograms)</p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Known as the "king of beasts," lions are one of the largest of the big cats. The males are bigger than the females and have a mane of long, shaggy hair around their head and shoulders. They have a long tail and are the only member of the cat family to have a tassel on the end of their tail. All lions have a sandy-colored coat that is paler on the underside. Lions live in groups called prides, and there are usually between 4 and 20 in a pride, made up of females and young, and one dominant male. Adult males live alone or with other males. True carnivores, females do most of the hunting as a team. They bring down large prey, such as zebra, wildebeest, and antelopes, but they allow the males to feast on the prey first, then the females eat, and finally the cubs. </p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>30,000&#8211;100,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Vulnerable</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Deserts and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 100&#8211;120 days and give birth to between 2&#8211;4 cubs. They breed every 2 years. Intruding lions may kill the cubs from a previous male in order to have their own cubs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 13&#8211;25 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>People have long hunted lions, but the recent sharp decline in their numbers has been due to habitat loss, conflict with people, disease, and poisoning. Lions need huge areas in which to hunt and this is becoming more and more difficult as the human population grows. Much of their grassland wildernesses have been overgrazed by herds of cattle, goats, and sheep, leaving less grazing for other animals, including the animals lions prey on. Hungry African lions then hunt livestock instead, and this brings them into conflict with local people who kill them by spearing or with poison. Domestic dogs carry the disease distemper, and this has spread to lions.</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>There are many National Parks and game reserves where lions are protected but many lions live on unprotected lands. Conservation organizations are working with local people to show them how to live with lions, rather than kill them. But poisoning remains a big threat. The commonly used poison, a pesticide called carbofuran, is very cheap to buy. Local people sprinkle the poison on the dead bodies of cattle and this kills any animal that eats the meat&#8212;lions, hyenas, jackals, and vultures. All these animals are declining in numbers. The pesticide has now been banned in Kenya, but is still available in other African countries.  </p>
