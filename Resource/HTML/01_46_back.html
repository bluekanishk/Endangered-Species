<h2 class="mam">NAME</h2>
<p><b>Gr&#233;vy's zebra</b></p>
<p><b>Scientific name:</b> <i>Equus grevyi</i></p>


<h2 class="mam">SIZE</h2>
<p><b>Length</b>: up to 8 feet (2.5 meters)  </p>
<p><b>Height</b>: up to 5 feet (1.5 meters)</p>
<p><b>Weight:</b> up to 770&#8211;990 pounds (350&#8211;450 kilograms) </p>

<h2 class="mam">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Gr&#233;vy's zebras have very thin black and white stripes, a white stomach, and a pale brown muzzle with a white edge, and a wide, black stripe along their back. Scientists now think the zebra's stripes help individuals to identify each other rather than being used for camouflage. Gr&#233;vy's zebras graze on dry, scrubby grasses and only need water every five days. But mothers that are suckling their young need to drink every two days. With climate and habitat changes this is not always possible and many young zebras die. They live in groups called herds. Zebras can run fast, have excellent eyesight, and can give a very nasty kick with their back legs.</p>

<h2 class="mam">HOW MANY LEFT IN THE WILD?</h2>
<p>Less than 2,000</p>

<h2 class="mam">RED LIST STATUS</h2>
<p>Endangered</p>

<h2 class="mam">HABITAT AND LOCATION</h2>
<p>Dry savannas of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia</p>

<h2 class="mam">BREEDING</h2>
<p>Females breed when they are about 2 years old. They are pregnant for 12 months and give birth to a single calf.</p>

<h2 class="mam">LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD</h2>
<p>About 25 years</p>

<h2 class="mam">WHY ARE THEY ENDANGERED?</h2>
<p>These zebras were hunted during the 1970s, which resulted in a rapid fall in their numbers. Since then, Gr&#233;vy's zebras have suffered from loss of habitat caused by expansion of farmland, roads, and new settlements. Recent droughts have also killed some of the population. Most of the remaining zebras live outside protected areas where they compete with herds of livestock for grazing. Often farmers prevent them from using waterholes because they want the water for their animals. The livestock have also transmitted diseases, such as anthrax and tick-borne diseases, to the zebras. </p>

<h2 class="mam">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP?</h2>
<p>Most of the efforts to conserve Gr&#233;vy's zebras are aimed at educating local farmers and looking for alternative ways of managing the land so that the zebras can survive alongside the livestock. New conservation areas owned by the community have been set up in Northern Kenya to provide additional protection for the zebras. </p>

<p class="wow mam"><b class="title">DID YOU KNOW?</b>In 1882, Menelik II, Emperor of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) thought the zebras in his country were so beautiful and majestic that he presented one to the president of France, Jules Gr&#233;vy, and the zebras were named after him.</p>
